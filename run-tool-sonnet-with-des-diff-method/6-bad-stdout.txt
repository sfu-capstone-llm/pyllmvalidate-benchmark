{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can see that it's attempting to fix the issue with parsing async/await keywords in Python 3.7+ generator expressions. However, there is a **critical bug** in the tokenizer logic that makes this fix incorrect.\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe bug is in `blib2to3/pgen2/tokenize.py` at line 517:\n\n```python\nif async_is_reserved_keyword and async_def:\n```\n\nThis condition requires **both** `async_is_reserved_keyword` AND `async_def` to be true for async/await to be tokenized as keywords. However, the test case from the issue shows:\n\n```python\ndef make_arange(n):\n    return (i * 2 for i in range(n) if await wrap(i))\n```\n\nIn this case:\n- `async_is_reserved_keyword` is `True` (for Python 3.7+)\n- `async_def` is `False` (because we're inside a regular `def`, not an `async def`)\n\nSince `async_def` is `False`, the condition `async_is_reserved_keyword and async_def` evaluates to `False`, so `await` gets tokenized as a regular `NAME` token instead of an `AWAIT` keyword token. This means the parser still can't handle the async generator syntax properly.\n\n## The Correct Fix\n\nThe condition should be:\n\n```python\nif async_is_reserved_keyword or async_def:\n```\n\nThis would ensure that in Python 3.7+ mode (`async_is_reserved_keyword=True`), async/await are always treated as keywords regardless of context, which is exactly what's needed to parse the new async generator syntax where `await` can appear in generator expressions outside of async functions.\n\nThe current implementation fails to fix the core issue because it still requires being inside an `async def` context, but the Python 3.7 syntax allows `await` in generators even within regular functions."}
