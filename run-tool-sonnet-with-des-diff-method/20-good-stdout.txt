{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug described in issue #130.\n\n**Reason:** The issue states that when using `black --diff path/to/foo.py`, the output only shows the filename (`foo.py`) instead of the full path (`path/to/foo.py`) in the diff headers. This makes it difficult to distinguish between files with the same name in different directories when viewing concatenated diffs.\n\nThe fix changes the diff header generation from using `src.name` (which only gives the filename) to using `src` (which gives the full path). Specifically:\n\n- `src.name` returns just the filename (e.g., \"foo.py\")  \n- `src` (the Path object when converted to string) returns the full path (e.g., \"path/to/foo.py\")\n\nBy changing:\n```python\nsrc_name = f\"{src.name}  (original)\"\ndst_name = f\"{src.name}  (formatted)\"\n```\n\nto:\n```python\nsrc_name = f\"{src}  (original)\"\ndst_name = f\"{src}  (formatted)\"\n```\n\nThe diff output will now show the complete file path in the headers, making it consistent with other diff-producing programs and solving the ambiguity issue when multiple files have the same name in different directories."}
