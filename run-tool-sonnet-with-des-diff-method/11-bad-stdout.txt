{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can see that it attempts to address the issue where Black incorrectly formats multiline function type annotation comments by combining them into malformed single-line comments.\n\n**This git diff is false/incorrect for the following reasons:**\n\n1. **Incomplete Logic**: The diff only prevents splitting lines that contain special comments, but it doesn't actually fix the core problem. The issue occurs when Black combines multiple lines with type comments into a single line, creating malformed annotations like `# type: int  # type: str  # type: bool`. This diff would prevent the line from being split further, but it doesn't prevent the initial incorrect combination of the comments.\n\n2. **Wrong Approach**: The fix is applied in the `split_line` function, which is responsible for splitting long lines. However, the actual problem occurs earlier in the formatting process when Black decides to combine multiple parameter lines into one. The diff should address the line combination logic, not the line splitting logic.\n\n3. **Missing Core Functionality**: The diff doesn't implement the suggested solutions from the issue description:\n   - Converting `# type: int  # type: str  # type: bool  # type: (...) -> None` to `# type: (int, str, bool) -> None`\n   - Moving long type annotations to separate lines\n   - Properly handling the restructuring of type annotations\n\n4. **Ineffective Prevention**: The `has_special_comment` check only looks at comments after commas, but the real issue is that when parameters are combined onto one line, their individual type comments get concatenated incorrectly. This check wouldn't prevent that initial incorrect combination.\n\nThe diff addresses a symptom (preventing further splitting of already malformed lines) rather than the root cause (the incorrect combination of type comments in the first place). A proper fix would need to modify the logic that decides how to format function parameters with type comments, ensuring they either stay on separate lines or are properly restructured into a single valid type annotation."}
