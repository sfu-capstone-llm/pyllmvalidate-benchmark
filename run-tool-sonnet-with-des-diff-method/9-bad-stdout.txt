{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The diff is false because it uses the wrong grammar for Python 2 compatibility.**\n\nThe key issue is in the `else` branch of the `get_grammars` function:\n\n```python\nelse:\n    return [pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement]  # WRONG\n```\n\nThis should be:\n```python\nelse:\n    return [pygram.python_grammar]  # CORRECT\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **The bug description** shows that when `--target-version py27` is used, Black incorrectly adds whitespace between `print` and `(`, changing `print(\"hello world\")` to `print (\"hello world\")`.\n\n2. **The root cause** is that Black needs to distinguish between:\n   - `print` as a **statement** (Python 2 style): `print \"hello world\"` \n   - `print` as a **function** (Python 3 style): `print(\"hello world\")`\n\n3. **When targeting Python 2** (`py27`), the code should use `pygram.python_grammar` which includes the print statement grammar. This allows the parser to correctly recognize when `print()` is being used as a function (with `from __future__ import print_function`) vs. as a statement.\n\n4. **The incorrect fix** uses `pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement`, which removes print statement support entirely. This forces the parser to always treat `print` as a function, but without the proper context, it incorrectly formats function calls by adding unnecessary whitespace.\n\n5. **The comment is also wrong** - it says \"Python 3-compatible code, so don't try Python 2 grammar\" but the condition is actually checking if we're targeting Python 2 (`else` branch when not all versions are Python 3).\n\nThe fix should preserve the original `pygram.python_grammar` to maintain proper print statement/function distinction when targeting Python 2."}
