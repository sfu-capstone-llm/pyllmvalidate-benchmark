{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff **correctly** fixes the bug described in issue #671.\n\n**Reason why this fix is correct:**\n\nThe original bug occurred because Black was blindly adding a trailing comma after the last element in import statements, even when that last element was a comment. This resulted in invalid Python syntax like:\n\n```python\nfrom .config import (\n    Any,\n    Bool,\n    #  String,\n    ,  # <- Invalid comma after comment\n)\n```\n\nThe fix addresses this by:\n\n1. **Iterating backwards** through the leaves to find the last non-comment element\n2. **Skipping standalone comments** (`STANDALONE_COMMENT` type) when looking for where to place the comma\n3. **Only adding a comma** if the last non-comment element isn't already a comma\n4. **Inserting the comma in the correct position** (after the last non-comment element, before any trailing comments)\n\nThe logic correctly handles the case where comments appear at the end of import statements by ensuring the trailing comma is placed after the last actual import name but before any comments, maintaining valid Python syntax while preserving Black's formatting style for imports.\n\nThis fix specifically targets the `bracket_split_build_line` function where the trailing comma logic for imports is handled, making it comment-aware rather than just checking the very last leaf regardless of type."}
