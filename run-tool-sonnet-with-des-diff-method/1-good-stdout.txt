{"is_correct": true, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can confirm that it **correctly fixes the bug**.\n\nHere's why this is the right solution:\n\n## The Problem\nThe issues describe that Black fails in virtualized environments like AWS Lambda where `/dev/shm` is not accessible or the filesystem is read-only. This causes `ProcessPoolExecutor` initialization to fail with an `OSError`, preventing Black from running at all.\n\n## The Solution Analysis\n\nThe diff implements a graceful fallback mechanism:\n\n1. **Try-catch around ProcessPoolExecutor creation**: The code wraps the `ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=worker_count)` call in a try-except block that catches `OSError`.\n\n2. **Graceful fallback**: When the OSError occurs (indicating the system doesn't support multiprocessing), it sets `executor = None` instead of crashing.\n\n3. **Proper cleanup handling**: The shutdown code is updated to check `if executor is not None:` before calling `executor.shutdown()`, preventing a null pointer exception.\n\n4. **Type annotation update**: The `executor` parameter in `schedule_formatting` is updated to `Optional[Executor]` to reflect that it can now be None.\n\n## Why This Fixes the Requirements\n\n- **Addresses Issue #1138**: Allows Black to run in AWS Lambda by gracefully handling the lack of `/dev/shm` access\n- **Addresses Issue #776**: Fixes the concurrency crash on systems with read-only filesystems by falling back to single-threaded execution\n- **Maintains functionality**: When multiprocessing works, it still uses it. When it doesn't, it falls back to single-threaded processing\n- **No breaking changes**: The fallback is transparent to users - Black still processes files, just without parallelism\n\nThe solution correctly implements the \"nice to have\" philosophy mentioned in the PR description - parallelism is attempted but if it fails, Black continues with single-threaded processing rather than crashing entirely."}
