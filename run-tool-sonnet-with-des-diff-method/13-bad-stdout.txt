{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why this fix is **incorrect**.\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe diff attempts to fix parsing of async generators by modifying the tokenizer to treat `for` the same way as `def` when preceded by `async`. However, this approach is fundamentally flawed for several reasons:\n\n### 1. **Incorrect Token Handling Logic**\n\nThe original code specifically handles `async def` constructs:\n```python\nif token == 'def':\n    if (stashed and stashed[0] == NAME and stashed[1] == 'async'):\n        async_def = True\n        async_def_indent = indents[-1]\n```\n\nThe fix changes this to:\n```python\nif token == 'def' or token == 'for':\n    if (stashed and stashed[0] == NAME and stashed[1] == 'async'):\n        async_def = True\n        async_def_indent = indents[-1]\n```\n\nThis is wrong because:\n- `async for` is not the same construct as `async def`\n- The variable name `async_def` and `async_def_indent` are specifically for async function definitions, not async generators\n- Async generators use `async for` in comprehensions/generator expressions, not as standalone statements\n\n### 2. **Misunderstanding the Bug**\n\nThe issue #125 is about parsing `return (i * 2 async for i in arange(n))` - this is an **async generator expression**, not an `async for` loop. The syntax being parsed is:\n- `(expression async for variable in iterable)` - async generator expression\n- NOT `async for variable in iterable:` - async for loop\n\n### 3. **Wrong Scope of Fix**\n\nThe tokenizer change affects all `async for` constructs, but the bug is specifically about async generator expressions within non-async functions. This fix would incorrectly tokenize legitimate `async for` loops.\n\n### 4. **Missing Core Issue**\n\nThe real issue is that the parser/grammar needs to understand that async generator expressions can appear in non-async contexts, but this tokenizer change doesn't address the grammar rules that actually parse generator expressions.\n\n## Correct Approach\n\nThe fix should involve:\n1. Updating the grammar rules to allow async generator expressions in non-async contexts\n2. Possibly updating the AST handling for these constructs\n3. NOT modifying the basic tokenization of `async for` constructs\n\nThis diff represents a superficial attempt that misunderstands both the syntax being fixed and the proper layer where the fix should be applied."}
