{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can identify several issues that indicate this fix is **incorrect**:\n\n## Primary Issues:\n\n1. **Missing `normalize_prefix` calls**: The original `delimiter_split` function had two critical `normalize_prefix(current_line.leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)` calls that have been completely removed. These calls are essential for proper indentation and formatting of bracketed expressions.\n\n2. **Incorrect function signature**: The diff changes `split_func(line, py36=py36)` to `split_func(line, py36)`, which removes the keyword argument. This could cause issues if the functions expect named parameters.\n\n3. **Logic error in `standalone_comment_split`**: The function has a `for...else` construct that will raise `CannotSplit` if no standalone comments are found at bracket depth 0, but then continues to process all leaves regardless. This logic is flawed.\n\n4. **Incomplete implementation**: The `append_to_line` helper function in `standalone_comment_split` has an unused `ValueError as ve` parameter and doesn't properly handle the exception case.\n\n## Specific Problems:\n\n- **Line 1689**: Removed `normalize_prefix(current_line.leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)` \n- **Line 1699**: Removed `normalize_prefix(current_line.leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)`\n- **Line 1495**: Changed from `split_func(line, py36=py36)` to `split_func(line, py36)`\n\nThe removal of `normalize_prefix` calls is particularly problematic because these are responsible for ensuring proper indentation within bracketed expressions. Without them, the formatted code will likely have incorrect indentation, which directly contradicts the goal of properly handling standalone comments within bracketed expressions.\n\nThe diff appears to be an incomplete implementation that removes critical formatting logic without properly replacing it."}
