{"is_correct": true, "reason": "Looking at this bug report and the provided diff, I can confirm that **this git diff correctly fixes the bug**.\n\n**Reason:**\n\nThe bug occurs because on Windows, the default encoding for temporary files is `cp1252` (Windows-1252), which cannot encode Unicode characters like `\\u0142` (\u0142 - Polish letter). The error traceback clearly shows:\n\n```\nUnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\\u0142' in position 4011: character maps to <undefined>\n```\n\nThe fix adds `encoding=\"utf8\"` parameter to the `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()` call in the `dump_to_file` function:\n\n```python\nwith tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(\n-    mode=\"w\", prefix=\"blk_\", suffix=\".log\", delete=False\n+    mode=\"w\", prefix=\"blk_\", suffix=\".log\", delete=False, encoding=\"utf8\"\n) as f:\n```\n\nThis change ensures that:\n\n1. **Cross-platform consistency**: UTF-8 encoding works uniformly across all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)\n2. **Unicode support**: UTF-8 can encode all Unicode characters, including the problematic `\\u0142` character that was causing the test failures\n3. **Minimal impact**: The change only affects the temporary file creation and doesn't alter the core functionality of the code formatter\n\nThe fix directly addresses the root cause identified in the PR description: \"This is not the default on Windows\" - by explicitly specifying UTF-8 encoding, the code no longer relies on platform-specific defaults that vary between operating systems."}
