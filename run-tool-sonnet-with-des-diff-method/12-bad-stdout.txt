{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can see that it attempts to fix a bracket matching bug in Black's formatter related to lambda expressions with default arguments. However, **this diff is incorrect** because it has a critical flaw in the logic.\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe main issue is in the `maybe_decrement_after_for_loop_variable` and `maybe_decrement_after_lambda_arguments` methods. The diff changes the tracking from simple counters to depth-based lists, but **fails to properly pop from the lists when decrementing**.\n\nNotice these commented-out lines in the diff:\n```python\n# self._for_loop_depths.pop()\n# self._lambda_argument_depths.pop()\n```\n\nThese lines are commented out, which means:\n\n1. **Memory leak**: The lists will keep growing and never shrink, accumulating depths from processed for-loops and lambda expressions\n2. **Incorrect depth matching**: Future checks will match against stale depths from previously processed constructs, leading to incorrect bracket matching behavior\n3. **Logic error**: The condition `self._lambda_argument_depths[-1] == self.depth` will eventually match incorrectly because old depths remain in the list\n\n## What Should Happen\n\nWhen a lambda's colon is found (or a for-loop's \"in\" keyword), the corresponding depth should be **removed** from the tracking list, not just left there. The correct implementation should uncomment and use:\n```python\nself._for_loop_depths.pop()\nself._lambda_argument_depths.pop()\n```\n\n## Impact on the Bug\n\nThe original issue was with lambda expressions containing default arguments with dictionary literals, like:\n```python\npem_spam = lambda l, spam = {\n    \"-----BEGIN PKCS7-----\": True, \"-----END PKCS7-----\": True, \"\": True\n}: not spam.get(l.strip())\n```\n\nWhile this diff attempts to fix the bracket tracking by using depth-aware lists instead of simple counters, the failure to properly clean up the tracking lists means the fix is incomplete and will likely cause other bracket matching issues in complex nested scenarios."}
