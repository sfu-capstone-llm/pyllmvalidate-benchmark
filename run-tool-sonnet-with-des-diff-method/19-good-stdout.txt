{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The fix is wrong because it prevents blank lines between comments and decorators, but the actual bug is that Black is adding blank lines between decorators when there's a comment in between.**\n\nLet me break down the issue:\n\n1. **The original problem**: When there's a comment between two decorators (like `@property # TODO: X @property`), Black was incorrectly adding blank lines, which violates PEP 8 and causes flake8 to complain with E304.\n\n2. **What the diff does**: The added code checks if the current line is a decorator AND the previous line is a comment, then returns `0, 0` (no blank lines). This prevents blank lines between comments and decorators.\n\n3. **Why this is wrong**: The condition `is_decorator and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_comment` will trigger when we have a decorator following a comment, but this doesn't address the core issue. The problem isn't about preventing blank lines between comments and decorators - it's about preventing blank lines between decorators when there's a comment in between them.\n\n4. **The correct approach should be**: The logic should recognize that when we have a sequence like `decorator -> comment -> decorator`, we shouldn't add blank lines between any of these elements, treating the entire sequence as a cohesive decorator block.\n\nThe current fix is too narrow and doesn't properly handle the decorator grouping logic. It only prevents blank lines when a decorator directly follows a comment, but doesn't address the broader issue of maintaining decorator block cohesion when comments are interspersed."}
