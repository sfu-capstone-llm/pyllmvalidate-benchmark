{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can see that it's attempting to fix the `# fmt: off` bug by removing the exception-based handling and replacing it with a separate pass approach. However, this diff is **incorrect** and will not properly fix the bug.\n\n**The reason this diff is false:**\n\nThe main issue is that the diff removes the exception-based handling (`FormatError`, `FormatOn`, `FormatOff` classes) and the `UnformattedLines` class, but the replacement mechanism in `normalize_fmt_off()` and `convert_one_fmt_off_pair()` is fundamentally flawed for handling `# fmt: off` directives that span across statement boundaries.\n\n**Specific problems:**\n\n1. **Incomplete conversion logic**: The `convert_one_fmt_off_pair()` function tries to convert `# fmt: off`/`# fmt: on` regions into standalone comments, but this approach doesn't properly preserve the original formatting of the code between these directives. The bug report shows that code within `# fmt: off` regions is still being reformatted (like the tuple formatting in `test_calculate_fades`).\n\n2. **Loss of state tracking**: The original exception-based approach with `UnformattedLines` maintained state about which lines should not be formatted. The new approach tries to convert everything to comments upfront, but this doesn't prevent the normal formatting logic from running on the content.\n\n3. **Boundary handling**: The original issue mentions that the hacky exception-based handling \"didn't work across statement boundaries.\" However, this diff doesn't actually solve that problem - it just removes the exception handling without providing a robust alternative that can properly track formatting state across multiple statements and function definitions.\n\n4. **Missing preservation of original formatting**: The bug report shows that both extra lines between functions are being inserted AND the list formatting is being changed. The new approach doesn't have a mechanism to preserve the exact original formatting of content within `# fmt: off` regions.\n\nThe diff appears to be an incomplete implementation that removes the problematic exception-based code but doesn't provide a working replacement mechanism that can properly handle `# fmt: off` directives across statement boundaries while preserving original formatting."}
