{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **incorrect** because it has a bug in the second line of the change.\n\nThe issue is on line 345:\n```python\ndst_name = f\"{src}  (original)\"\n```\n\nThis should be:\n```python\ndst_name = f\"{src}  (formatted)\"\n```\n\nThe diff correctly changes `src.name` to `src` to show the full path (which fixes the main issue), but it mistakenly changes the label for the formatted version from \"(formatted)\" to \"(original)\". This means both the original and formatted versions would be labeled as \"(original)\" in the diff output, which would be confusing and incorrect.\n\nThe correct fix should be:\n```python\nsrc_name = f\"{src}  (original)\"\ndst_name = f\"{src}  (formatted)\"\n```\n\nThis would properly show the full file path while maintaining the correct labels to distinguish between the original and formatted versions of the file."}
