{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The fix is false because it has a critical logic error in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function.**\n\nThe main issue is in this section:\n\n```python\n# fix for fmt: on in children\nif contains_fmt_on_at_column(container, leaf.column):\n    for child in container.children:\n        if contains_fmt_on_at_column(child, leaf.column):\n            return\n        yield child\nelse:\n    yield container\n    container = container.next_sibling\n```\n\n**The problem:** When `contains_fmt_on_at_column(container, leaf.column)` is true, the code iterates through all children and yields each child that does NOT contain `fmt: on` at the specified column. However, it's missing the crucial step of advancing to the next container - there's no `container = container.next_sibling` in this branch.\n\nThis creates an infinite loop because:\n1. The function finds a container that contains `fmt: on` at the target column\n2. It processes all the children \n3. But never advances `container` to the next sibling\n4. The while loop continues with the same container indefinitely\n\nThe correct logic should either:\n- Set `container = container.next_sibling` after processing children, OR  \n- Use `break` or `return` to exit the loop appropriately, OR\n- Restructure the logic to properly handle container advancement\n\nThis infinite loop would cause Black to hang when processing code with `fmt: on` comments that cross block boundaries, making the fix worse than the original bug."}
