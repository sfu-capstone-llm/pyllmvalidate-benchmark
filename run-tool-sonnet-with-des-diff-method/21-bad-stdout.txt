{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **incorrect** because it uses `encoding=\"latin1\"` instead of `encoding=\"utf-8\"`.\n\n**Reason why this fix is wrong:**\n\nThe PR title explicitly states \"Open temporary files with utf-8 encoding\" and the issue description shows that the problem is caused by Unicode characters (specifically `\\u0142`) that cannot be encoded in the Windows default encoding (cp1252). \n\nThe error occurs because:\n1. Windows defaults to cp1252 encoding for temporary files\n2. The test data contains Unicode character `\\u0142` (Polish letter \u0142)\n3. cp1252 cannot encode this character, causing a `UnicodeEncodeError`\n\nThe correct solution should be `encoding=\"utf-8\"` to properly handle Unicode characters, but this diff uses `encoding=\"latin1\"` instead. While latin1 might happen to work for this specific character, it's not the intended fix and doesn't align with the PR requirements. UTF-8 is the proper encoding for handling arbitrary Unicode characters in a cross-platform manner."}
