{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **correct** and properly fixes the bug described in the issue.\n\nThe diff correctly addresses the core problem: Black couldn't parse Python 3.7+ async generator syntax like `return (i * 2 for i in range(n) if await wrap(i))` because the tokenizer couldn't determine when `async`/`await` should be treated as keywords vs identifiers in all contexts.\n\n**Key aspects of the correct fix:**\n\n1. **Introduces tokenizer configuration**: The diff adds a `TokenizerConfig` class with an `async_is_reserved_keyword` flag that controls whether `async`/`await` are always treated as keywords.\n\n2. **Version-specific feature flags**: It adds mutually exclusive features `ASYNC_IS_VALID_IDENTIFIER` (Python \u22643.6) and `ASYNC_IS_RESERVED_KEYWORD` (Python 3.7+) to properly distinguish between Python versions.\n\n3. **Parser configuration system**: Replaces the simple grammar list with `ParserConfig` objects that combine grammar and tokenizer settings, allowing different tokenization modes for different Python versions.\n\n4. **Correct tokenizer logic**: In `tokenize.py`, the key change is:\n   ```python\n   if async_is_reserved_keyword or async_def:\n   ```\n   This ensures that when `async_is_reserved_keyword=True` (Python 3.7+), `async`/`await` are always tokenized as keywords, even outside async function contexts.\n\n5. **Proper fallback handling**: The `get_parser_configs` function correctly handles cases where no target version is specified by trying multiple configurations in the right order.\n\n6. **Test coverage**: Includes test cases for the specific syntax that was failing.\n\nThe fix directly addresses the issue described in #593 where `return (i * 2 for i in range(n) if await wrap(i))` couldn't be parsed, by ensuring that for Python 3.7+, `await` is always recognized as a keyword even in generator expressions."}
