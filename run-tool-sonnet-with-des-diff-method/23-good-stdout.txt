{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can see that it's attempting to fix the issue where Black was incorrectly adding spaces before parentheses for `exec` and `print` when they appear as Python 2-style statements rather than Python 3 function calls.\n\nHowever, **this diff is incorrect** for the following reasons:\n\n## Primary Issue: Incomplete Grammar Handling\n\nThe diff adds multiple grammars to handle different combinations of print/exec statements:\n- `python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement`\n- `python_grammar_no_print_statement` \n- `python_grammar_no_exec_statement`\n- `python_grammar`\n\nBut the logic in `lib2to3_parse()` tries each grammar in sequence and only raises an exception if ALL grammars fail. This approach is flawed because:\n\n1. **Wrong Grammar Selection**: The code doesn't track which grammar successfully parsed the code, so downstream formatting decisions don't know whether `exec`/`print` should be treated as statements or functions.\n\n2. **Exception Handling Bug**: The code has a serious bug where `exc` is only defined inside the `except` block, but it's referenced in the `else` clause of the `for` loop. If the last grammar in the list succeeds, `exc` will be undefined, causing a `NameError`.\n\n## Secondary Issues:\n\n3. **Incomplete Whitespace Logic**: The diff adds logic to detect Python 2 print chevron syntax (`print >>`) but doesn't add corresponding logic for `exec` statements, making the fix incomplete.\n\n4. **Test Coverage**: The test file shows `exec(\"new-style exec\", {}, {})` which is Python 3 function syntax, not the Python 2 statement syntax that the fix is supposed to handle.\n\n## What Should Happen:\n\nThe fix should:\n- Properly track which grammar was used to parse the code\n- Use that information to make formatting decisions about whether `exec`/`print` are statements or functions  \n- Handle both `exec` and `print` consistently in the whitespace logic\n- Include proper test cases for Python 2-style `exec` and `print` statements\n\nThe current diff will likely cause runtime errors due to the undefined `exc` variable and won't properly distinguish between Python 2 statement syntax and Python 3 function syntax for formatting purposes."}
