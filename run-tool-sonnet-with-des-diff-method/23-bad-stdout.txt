{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at the bug description and the code diff, I can see that this diff is **incorrect** for fixing the stated bug.\n\n**The reason this diff is false:**\n\nThe bug report in Issue #49 states that Black is incorrectly adding a space before parentheses for built-in functions like `exec` and `eval`, changing:\n```python\nreturn exec(\"code\", {}, {})\n```\nto:\n```python\nreturn exec (\"code\", {}, {})\n```\n\nHowever, this code diff does not address the spacing issue at all. Instead, it:\n\n1. **Adds grammar parsing logic** to handle different Python grammar variants (with/without print/exec statements)\n2. **Adds a specific whitespace rule** for Python 2 print chevron syntax (`print >>`)\n3. **Does not fix the core spacing issue** for function calls to `exec` and `eval`\n\nThe diff includes a whitespace rule for Python 2 print chevron syntax:\n```python\nelif (\n    prevp.type == token.RIGHTSHIFT\n    and prevp.parent\n    and prevp.parent.type == syms.shift_expr\n    and prevp.prev_sibling\n    and prevp.prev_sibling.type == token.NAME\n    and prevp.prev_sibling.value == 'print'\n):\n    # Python 2 print chevron\n    return NO\n```\n\nBut this only handles the `print >>` case, not the general issue of spacing before parentheses for `exec()` and `eval()` function calls.\n\nThe actual bug requires identifying when `exec` or `eval` are being used as function calls (Python 3 style) versus statements (Python 2 style) and ensuring proper spacing is applied. This diff focuses on parsing different grammar variants but doesn't implement the logic to prevent the unwanted space insertion for these built-in functions when used as function calls."}
