{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **incorrect** and does not properly fix the bug.\n\n**Reason:** The diff adds blank lines **after** decorator comments, but the bug description shows that Black is incorrectly adding blank lines **before** the next decorator when there's a comment between decorators.\n\nLooking at the original issue:\n- Input: `@property` \u2192 `# TODO: X` \u2192 `@property` \u2192 `def foo():`\n- Black incorrectly adds 2 blank lines between the comment and the second `@property`\n- This violates flake8's E304 rule about blank lines after function decorators\n\nThe proposed fix adds logic to insert `1, 0` (one blank line) when `is_decorator` is true and the previous line is a comment. However, this would:\n\n1. **Still add unwanted blank lines** - The fix adds a blank line after decorator comments, but the correct behavior should be to add NO blank lines between decorators, even when there are comments between them.\n\n2. **Misunderstands the problem** - The issue isn't that we need to add blank lines after decorator comments; it's that we need to prevent adding blank lines when we're in a decorator sequence that contains comments.\n\n3. **Doesn't address the root cause** - The existing logic \"Don't insert empty lines between decorators\" should apply even when there are comments between decorators, but the current implementation doesn't handle this case.\n\nThe correct fix should modify the decorator detection logic to recognize that comments between decorators are still part of the decorator sequence, and therefore no blank lines should be inserted."}
