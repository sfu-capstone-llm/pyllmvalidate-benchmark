{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can identify several issues that make this fix incorrect:\n\n## The fix is **INCORRECT** for the following reasons:\n\n### 1. **Incomplete Logic in `no_commas` Variable**\n\nThe `no_commas` logic is fundamentally flawed:\n\n```python\nno_commas = original.is_def and not any(\n    l.type == token.COMMA for l in leaves\n)\n```\n\nThis condition checks if there are NO commas in the leaves, but the bug description shows that functions with one argument **should keep** their trailing comma. The logic should be ensuring trailing commas are preserved for single-argument functions, not removing them when there are no commas.\n\n### 2. **Incorrect Application of `no_commas` Condition**\n\nThe fix applies `no_commas` to the import trailing comma logic:\n\n```python\nif original.is_import and not no_commas:\n```\n\nThis means that when `no_commas` is True (i.e., for function definitions with no commas), it will skip adding trailing commas to imports. This creates unintended side effects where the function definition logic interferes with import formatting.\n\n### 3. **Missing Implementation for Function Definitions**\n\nThe diff shows logic for detecting function arguments (`syms.typedargslist` addition) and a `no_commas` variable, but there's no actual implementation that ensures single-argument functions keep their trailing comma. The bug description clearly states that single-argument functions should preserve trailing commas, but the diff doesn't add any code to handle this case.\n\n### 4. **Logic Contradiction**\n\nThe expected behavior from the issue is:\n- Single argument function: `def one(a,):` (keep trailing comma)\n- Multi argument function: `def two(a, b):` (remove trailing comma)\n\nBut the `no_commas` variable would be `True` for functions without any commas, which doesn't address the case where a single-argument function already has a trailing comma that should be preserved.\n\nThe fix appears to be incomplete and contains logical errors that would not resolve the reported bug."}
