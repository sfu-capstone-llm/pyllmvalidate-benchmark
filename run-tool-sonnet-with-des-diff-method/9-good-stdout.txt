{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The diff is false because it has the wrong logic in the conditional check.**\n\nThe bug is in this line:\n```python\nelif all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):\n```\n\nThis condition checks if **all** target versions are **not** Python 2 (i.e., all are Python 3+). However, the comment and the return statement are backwards:\n\n1. **Wrong comment**: The comment says \"Python 3-compatible code, so don't try Python 2 grammar\" but the condition actually checks for Python 3-only versions\n2. **Wrong grammar selection**: When targeting Python 2 (py27), this condition will be `False` because `version.is_python2()` returns `True`, making `not version.is_python2()` return `False`, so `all(...)` returns `False`\n\nThe issue described in #752 is that when using `--target-version py27`, Black incorrectly adds whitespace around `print()` calls. This happens because:\n\n1. When `target_versions` contains `py27`, the condition `all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)` evaluates to `False`\n2. The code falls through to the `else` clause which returns `[pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement, pygram.python_grammar]`\n3. This causes the parser to treat `print` as a function rather than a statement, leading to the unwanted whitespace formatting\n\nThe correct fix should ensure that when targeting Python 2, the appropriate grammar that treats `print` as a statement is used, not the one that treats it as a function."}
