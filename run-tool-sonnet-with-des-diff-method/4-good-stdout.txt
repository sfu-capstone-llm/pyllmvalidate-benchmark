{"is_correct": true, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can confirm that **this fix correctly addresses the bug**.\n\nHere's why this solution is correct:\n\n## The Problem\nThe bug occurred when Black encountered a backslash line continuation (`\\`) at the very beginning of a file. The `EmptyLineTracker` was incorrectly calculating that empty lines should be inserted before the first actual code line, leading to:\n1. First pass: Removes the backslash and empty line, but leaves one empty line\n2. Second pass: Removes that remaining empty line\n3. Result: Unstable formatting (different output on consecutive runs)\n\n## The Solution Analysis\nThe fix modifies the `_maybe_empty_lines` method in `EmptyLineTracker` to handle the special case when `self.previous_line is None` (indicating we're at the beginning of the file):\n\n```python\nbefore = (\n    # Black should not insert empty lines at the beginning\n    # of the file\n    0\n    if self.previous_line is None\n    else before - self.previous_after\n)\n```\n\n## Why This Fix Is Correct\n\n1. **Addresses Root Cause**: The fix directly prevents empty lines from being inserted at the beginning of files, which is the core issue described in the bug report.\n\n2. **Maintains Black's Philosophy**: As noted in the PR description, \"there should be no situation where Black outputs a file formatted with empty lines at the beginning.\" This aligns with Black's consistent formatting principles.\n\n3. **Surgical Fix**: The change is minimal and targeted - it only affects the calculation when we're at the very beginning of a file (`previous_line is None`), leaving all other formatting logic intact.\n\n4. **Prevents Instability**: By ensuring `before = 0` at the file start, it eliminates the condition that caused different outputs on successive formatting passes.\n\n5. **Safe Implementation**: The conditional check ensures this only applies to the first line, preserving all existing behavior for the rest of the file.\n\nThe fix correctly resolves the unstable formatting issue by ensuring Black never inserts empty lines at the beginning of files, which eliminates the inconsistency that caused different outputs on repeated formatting passes."}
