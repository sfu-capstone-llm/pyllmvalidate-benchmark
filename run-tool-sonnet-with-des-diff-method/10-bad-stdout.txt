{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The diff removes the tab handling logic entirely, which is wrong.**\n\nThe original code correctly handled tabs by adding 4 to the column count:\n```python\nelif char == '\\t':\n    current_column += 4\n```\n\nThe diff removes this logic completely, leaving only space handling:\n```python\nelif char == ' ':\n    current_column += 1\n```\n\n**Why this is wrong:**\n\n1. **The PR description states the opposite requirement**: It says \"Indent widths in lib2to3 for tabs are actually counted as 1, not 4\" - but the diff removes tab handling entirely rather than changing it to count as 1.\n\n2. **Tabs still need to be handled**: Even if tabs should count as 1 instead of 4, they still need explicit handling. Without the `elif char == '\\t':` case, tabs will fall through to the default behavior, which likely doesn't increment the column counter at all.\n\n3. **The fix should be**:\n```python\nelif char == '\\t':\n    current_column += 1  # Changed from += 4 to += 1\n```\n\n4. **The issue description shows tab indentation problems**: The bug report shows that tabulated comments are being incorrectly indented after dedents. Removing tab handling entirely won't fix this - it will likely make it worse by not tracking tab positions at all.\n\nThe correct fix should change the tab increment from 4 to 1, not remove tab handling completely. This diff fails to properly address the stated requirement and will likely break tab handling entirely."}
