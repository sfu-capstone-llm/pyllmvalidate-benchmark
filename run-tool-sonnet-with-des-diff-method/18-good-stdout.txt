{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **false** because it **breaks the existing behavior for --diff and stdout output**.\n\nThe main issue is in the `format_file_in_place` function where the diff changes how `--diff` output is handled:\n\n```python\n# Before (correct):\nsys.stdout.write(diff_contents)\n\n# After (incorrect):\nf = io.TextIOWrapper(\n    sys.stdout.buffer,\n    encoding=encoding,\n    newline=newline,\n    write_through=True,\n)\nf.write(diff_contents)\nf.detach()\n```\n\n**Why this is wrong:**\n\n1. **The PR description explicitly states**: \"Note that this only changes behavior when black writes back to the file. In other cases like when using --diff or writing to stdout, I think it's reasonable to expect the caller to handle line endings.\"\n\n2. **The requirement is clear**: Only preserve line endings when writing back to the original file (`write_back == WriteBack.YES`), not when outputting diffs or writing to stdout.\n\n3. **The diff violates this requirement** by also changing the behavior for:\n   - `--diff` output in `format_file_in_place`\n   - `--diff` output in `format_stdin_to_stdout` \n   - stdout output in `format_stdin_to_stdout`\n\n4. **This breaks the expected behavior** where diff output and stdout output should use the system's default line endings, not preserve the source file's line endings.\n\nThe correct fix should only modify the file write-back case (`write_back == WriteBack.YES`) and leave all other output methods unchanged to use the system defaults."}
