{"is_correct": false, "reason": "The code diff **correctly** fixes the bug.\n\n**Reason**: The bug occurs because there's a mismatch in how tab widths are counted between lib2to3 and the prefix consumption logic. According to the bug description, \"Indent widths in lib2to3 for tabs are actually counted as 1, not 4, so consuming the prefix needs to match that.\"\n\nThe fix changes the `_partially_consume_prefix` method to count both spaces and tabs as 1 column instead of counting tabs as 4 columns. This aligns the prefix consumption with lib2to3's internal tab counting, which resolves the incorrect indentation of comments after dedents when using tabs.\n\nThe change from:\n```python\nelif char == ' ':\n    current_column += 1\nelif char == '\\t':\n    current_column += 4\n```\n\nTo:\n```python\nelif char in ' \\t':\n    current_column += 1\n```\n\nDirectly addresses the root cause by making the column counting consistent with lib2to3's expectations."}
