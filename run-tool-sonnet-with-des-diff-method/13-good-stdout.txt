{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **false** because it introduces a critical bug in the tokenizer logic.\n\nThe main issue is in this section:\n```python\nif token in ('def', 'for'):\n    if (stashed\n            and stashed[0] == NAME\n            and stashed[1] == 'async'):\n\n        if token == 'def':\n            async_def = True\n            async_def_indent = indents[-1]\n\n        yield (ASYNC, stashed[1],\n               stashed[2], stashed[3],\n```\n\n**The Problem:**\nWhen `token == 'for'` (i.e., when processing async generators like `async for`), the code will:\n1. Detect the `async for` pattern correctly\n2. **Skip setting `async_def = True` and `async_def_indent`** (which is correct for async generators)\n3. **But still yield the ASYNC token**\n\nHowever, the code that consumes/handles this ASYNC token likely expects the `async_def` state to be properly managed. By yielding an ASYNC token without properly tracking the async context for generators, this creates an inconsistent state in the tokenizer.\n\n**Additional Issues:**\n1. The original `async_def` and `async_def_indent` variables were specifically designed for async function definitions, not async generators\n2. Async generators have different scoping and context rules than async functions\n3. The fix doesn't handle the cleanup or state management that might be needed when exiting an async generator context\n\n**What should happen instead:**\nThe fix should either:\n1. Introduce separate state tracking for async generators (like `async_gen` and `async_gen_indent`)\n2. Or modify the existing logic to properly handle both async functions and async generators with appropriate state management\n3. Ensure that the ASYNC token yielding is consistent with the internal state tracking\n\nThis incomplete fix will likely cause parsing errors or incorrect AST generation when processing async generators."}
