{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can see that it attempts to fix the issue where Black incorrectly formats multiline function type annotation comments by combining them into a malformed single line.\n\n**This git diff is FALSE because it has a critical logical flaw.**\n\nThe main issue is in the `split_line` function where the code checks for special comments:\n\n```python\nhas_special_comment = False\nfor leaf in line.leaves:\n    for comment in line.comments_after(leaf):\n        if leaf.type == token.COMMA and is_special_comment(comment):\n            has_special_comment = True\n```\n\n**The problem:** This code only sets `has_special_comment = True` when it finds a type comment that comes after a COMMA token. However, according to the bug description, the issue also occurs with the return type annotation comment that comes after the closing parenthesis `)`, not after a comma.\n\nIn the example from the issue:\n```python\ndef f(a,  # type: int\n      b,  # type: str  \n      c,  # type: bool\n      ):  # type: (...) -> None\n    ...\n```\n\nThe return type comment `# type: (...) -> None` comes after the `)` token, not after a comma. So this fix would miss that case and still allow Black to incorrectly combine the lines, resulting in the malformed output:\n\n```python\ndef f(a, b, c):  # type: int  # type: str  # type: bool  # type: (...) -> None\n```\n\nThe fix should check for type comments after any relevant token in function parameter lists (commas, closing parentheses, etc.), not just commas. The condition `leaf.type == token.COMMA` is too restrictive and doesn't cover all the cases mentioned in the bug report."}
