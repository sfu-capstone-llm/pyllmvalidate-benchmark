# PR - add parentheses around tuple unpack assignment

Fixes #656

# Issue #656 - line not shortened if it starts as a backslashed tuple assignment left side

Operating system: Fedora 29
Python version: 3.7.0
Black version: 18.9b0
Does also happen on master: seems that way, reproduces on web tool as well

given code:

def test_of_type(self):
    JuniorEngineer, Company, companies, Manager, \
        Employee, employees, Engineer, Programmer = (
         self.classes.JuniorEngineer,
         self.classes.Company,
         self.tables.companies,
         self.classes.Manager,
         self.classes.Employee,
         self.tables.employees,
         self.classes.Engineer,
         self.classes.Programmer)
comes out as:

def test_of_type(self):
    JuniorEngineer, Company, companies, Manager, Employee, employees, Engineer, Programmer = (
        self.classes.JuniorEngineer,
        self.classes.Company,
        self.tables.companies,
        self.classes.Manager,
        self.classes.Employee,
        self.tables.employees,
        self.classes.Engineer,
        self.classes.Programmer,
    )
