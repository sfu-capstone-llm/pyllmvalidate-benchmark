# PR - Fix indent calculation with tabs when computing prefixes

Closes #262, bug seems to have been introduced in 54d707e. Indent widths in lib2to3 for tabs are actually counted as 1, not 4, so consuming the prefix needs to match that.

# Issue #262 - Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent

Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04
Python version: 3.6.3
Black version: master

Thank you @ambv for this library. When trying to run this on a codebase that uses tabs, indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent. Sample input (NB tabs):

if 1:
	if 2:
		pass
	# This comment should be indented the same as the next line
	pass
Black reformats this to:

if 1:
    if 2:
        pass
        # This comment should be indented the same as the next line
    pass
Note that this only happens when the input file uses tabs.
