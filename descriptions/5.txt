# PR - Fix trailing comma for function with one arg (#880)

Modified maybe_remove_trailing_comma to remove trailing commas for typedarglists (in addition to arglists), and updated line split logic to ensure that all lines in a function definition that contain only one arg have a trailing comma.

Some discussion points:

There are likely some edge cases to consider with the use of no_commas. Would be great to hear any other suggestions for this test.
The new test data file should probably be folded into one of the existing function test files, are there any guidelines around this?
It looks like this will clash with Pull request tweak collection literals to explode with trailing comma #826.

# Issue #880 - Trailing comma for function with one arg

A function with one argument keeps the trailing comma but if there are two it is stripped.

In:

def one(
    a,
):
    pass

def two(
    a,
    b,
):
    pass
Out

def one(a,):
    pass


def two(a, b):
    pass
