# PR - [#154] Handle comments between decorators properly

# Issue #154 - Adds blank lines after comment between decorators

Given t.py:

@property
# TODO: X
@property
def foo():
    pass
Running black --diff t.py gives:

--- t-black.py  (original)
+++ t-black.py  (formatted)
@@ -1,6 +1,8 @@
 @property
 # TODO: X
+
+
 @property
 def foo():
     pass
Where flake8 then complains:

stdin:5:1: E304 blank lines found after function decorator

Operating system: Arch Linux
Python version: 3.6.5
Black version: 18.4a2
Does also happen on master: Haven't checked.
