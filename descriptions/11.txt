# PR - Add support for special comments in multiline functions

This is a starter diff to deal with #282, and I'm happy to iterate on it.

We want to ensure that type comments (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) for Python 2 are formatted in a valid way, so that we can use Black in our organization.

# Issue #282 - Breaks multiline function type annotation comments

Operating system: Fedora 27 4.13.9-300.fc27.x86_64)
Python version: 3.6.2
Black version: 18.5b1
Does also happen on master: yes

PEP484 was amended (python/typing#186) to extend Python 2 compatible type annotation comments to allow placing each function parameter on a separate line with its own type annotation and the return type at the end. The motivation for this was to be able to write type annotations which would otherwise extend beyond the maximum line limit. But when it will fit in the maximum line length, Black combines all the arguments onto one line, including the type annotations, which become malformed.

Given this input

def f(a,  # type: int
      b,  # type: str
      c,  # type: bool
      ):  # type: (...) -> None
    ...
Black produces this

def f(a, b, c):  # type: int  # type: str  # type: bool  # type: (...) -> None
    ...
which has a malformed type annotation.

I think the correct behaviour would be either leave the function parameters on separate lines (do nothing) or restructure the type annotation like this:

def f(a, b, c):  # (int, str, bool) -> None
    ...
or if the resultant line is too long, this

def f(a, b, c): 
    # (int, str, bool) -> None
    ...
This might deserve a separate issue, but it'd be nice if Black did the reverse as well: given a very long function type annotation on one line, annotate each parameter separately.
