Automatic detection of deprecated Python 2 forms of print and exec
Note: if those are handled, you can't use --safe because this check is using
Python 3.6+ builtin AST.

Fixes #49

# Issue #49 - Space before method brackets for built-in functions

I have the problem that black does a reformat of built-in functions, in my case on exec and eval as those have been statements in Python 2 but are methods in Python 3.

-        return exec("code", {}, {})
+        return exec ("code", {}, {})
Operating system: MacOS
Python version: 3.6.4
Black version: black, version 18.3a3
Does also happen on master: Yes
