{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately see why it's incorrect.\n\n**The diff is FALSE because it removes the tab handling logic entirely instead of fixing it.**\n\nThe bug description states that \"Indent widths in lib2to3 for tabs are actually counted as 1, not 4, so consuming the prefix needs to match that.\" The issue is that the original code was treating tabs as having a width of 4 characters when calculating column positions, but lib2to3 actually treats tabs as having a width of 1.\n\nHowever, the diff completely removes the tab handling case:\n\n```python\n-            elif char == '\\t':\n-                current_column += 4\n```\n\nThis means tabs are no longer handled at all in the column calculation. The correct fix should have been to change `current_column += 4` to `current_column += 1` to match lib2to3's tab width calculation, not to remove the tab handling entirely.\n\nBy removing the tab case completely, tabs will now fall through to the `else` clause which sets `wait_for_nl = True`, treating tabs as non-whitespace characters that end the indentation. This is incorrect behavior - tabs should still be counted as whitespace that contributes to column positioning, just with the correct width of 1 instead of 4.\n\nThe correct fix should be:\n```python\nelif char == '\\t':\n    current_column += 1  # Changed from += 4 to += 1\n```"}
