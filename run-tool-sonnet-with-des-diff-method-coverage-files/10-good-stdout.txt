{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at the bug description and the code diff, I can immediately identify why this fix is **incorrect**.\n\n## The Fix is False\n\nThe diff changes the column counting logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` method:\n\n```python\n# Before (incorrect fix):\nelif char in ' \\t':\n    current_column += 1\n\n# Original code was:\nelif char == ' ':\n    current_column += 1\nelif char == '\\t':\n    current_column += 4\n```\n\n**The problem is that this fix treats tabs and spaces identically (both increment by 1), but this contradicts the bug description and the actual requirements.**\n\n## Why This Fix is Wrong\n\n1. **Contradicts the PR description**: The PR states \"Indent widths in lib2to3 for tabs are actually counted as 1, not 4\" - but the fix makes both spaces AND tabs count as 1, when only tabs should count as 1.\n\n2. **Breaks space handling**: The original code correctly counted spaces as 1 column each. The fix now incorrectly treats spaces the same as tabs.\n\n3. **Doesn't match the bug report**: The issue #262 shows that the problem is specifically with tab indentation calculation. The fix should only change how tabs are counted, not how spaces are counted.\n\n## What the Correct Fix Should Be\n\nThe correct fix should be:\n```python\nelif char == ' ':\n    current_column += 1\nelif char == '\\t':\n    current_column += 1  # Changed from += 4 to += 1\n```\n\nThis would:\n- Keep space counting at 1 (correct)\n- Change tab counting from 4 to 1 (as required by the PR description)\n- Only affect tab handling, which is what the bug report indicates is the problem\n\nThe current diff incorrectly combines both space and tab handling into a single condition that treats them identically, which will break proper space indentation handling while trying to fix tab indentation."}
