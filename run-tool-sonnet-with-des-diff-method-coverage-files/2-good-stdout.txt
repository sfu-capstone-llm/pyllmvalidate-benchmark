{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at the bug description and the code diff, I need to analyze whether the fix correctly handles the \"# fmt: on\" directive when it appears within decorators or other block boundaries.\n\nThe issue is that \"# fmt: on\" doesn't work when crossing block boundaries, particularly with decorators. The original code in `generate_ignored_nodes` would continue yielding nodes until it found a container with \"# fmt: on\" in its prefix, but it didn't handle cases where \"# fmt: on\" appeared in child nodes at the same indentation level.\n\nThe fix adds:\n1. A new function `fmt_on()` that extracts the logic for checking if a container has \"# fmt: on\"\n2. A new function `contains_fmt_on_at_column()` that checks if any child at a specific column has \"# fmt: on\"\n3. A new function `first_leaf_column()` to get the column of the first leaf in a node\n4. Modified logic in `generate_ignored_nodes()` to handle the case where \"# fmt: on\" appears in children at the same column\n\nThe key change is in `generate_ignored_nodes()`:\n- If a container has \"# fmt: on\" at the same column as the original leaf, it processes each child separately\n- It stops when it finds a child that contains \"# fmt: on\" at that column\n- Otherwise, it continues with the original behavior\n\nThis approach correctly addresses the issue described in the GitHub issue where \"# fmt: on\" within a decorator block wasn't being recognized because it was in a child node rather than the container's prefix.\n\nThe fix appears to handle the semantic meaning of Python indentation correctly by checking column positions, which aligns with the PR description's assumption about indentation having semantic meaning.\n\n**True** - The code diff correctly fixes the bug by properly handling \"# fmt: on\" directives that appear within child nodes at the same indentation level, which resolves the issue with decorators and other block boundaries not respecting the formatting directive."}
