{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The diff is false because it has the logic backwards in the `get_grammars` function.**\n\nThe issue is in this section of the diff:\n\n```python\nelif all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):\n-    # Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar.\n+    # Python 3-compatible code, so don't try Python 2 grammar\n    return [\n        pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,\n        pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,\n    ]\nelse:\n-    return [pygram.python_grammar]\n+    return [pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement, pygram.python_grammar]\n```\n\n**The problem:** The condition `all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)` means \"all target versions are NOT Python 2\" (i.e., they are Python 3+). However, the original code comment says \"Python 2-compatible code\" which is wrong - this branch actually handles Python 3-only code.\n\n**What the fix should be:** When targeting Python 2 (the `else` branch), the code should use grammars that support Python 2 syntax, including the print statement. The diff correctly tries to add `pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement` first, but this is backwards.\n\n**The correct fix should be:**\n- When targeting Python 3+ only: use grammars without print statement support\n- When targeting Python 2 (or mixed): use grammars that include print statement support, with the print statement grammar (`pygram.python_grammar`) tried first\n\nThe current diff puts `python_grammar_no_print_statement` before `python_grammar` in the Python 2 case, which means it will try to parse Python 2 code (which may contain print statements) using a grammar that doesn't support print statements, causing the issue described in the bug report."}
