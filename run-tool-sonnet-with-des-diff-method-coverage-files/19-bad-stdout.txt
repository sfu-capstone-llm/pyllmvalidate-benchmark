{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The diff is false because it adds blank lines in the wrong scenario.**\n\nThe issue description states that the problem occurs when there are **comments between decorators**, specifically:\n\n```python\n@property\n# TODO: X\n@property\ndef foo():\n    pass\n```\n\nHowever, the fix in the diff adds a condition that triggers when:\n1. The current line is a decorator (`is_decorator` is True)\n2. The previous line is a comment (`self.previous_line.is_comment` is True)\n\nThis logic is backwards. The condition should trigger when:\n1. The current line is a **comment** \n2. The previous line is a **decorator**\n\nThe current fix would incorrectly add blank lines after any comment that precedes a decorator, but the actual problem described in the issue is that Black is adding unwanted blank lines after comments that appear **between** decorators.\n\nThe correct fix should prevent blank lines from being added when a comment appears between decorators, not add more blank lines. The issue shows that Black is incorrectly adding two blank lines after the comment `# TODO: X`, which causes a flake8 E304 error about blank lines after function decorators.\n\nThe fix should instead handle the case where we have a comment between decorators and ensure that no extra blank lines are added in that specific scenario."}
