{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately see the issue:\n\n**This git diff is FALSE because it changes the wrong parameter.**\n\nThe diff changes the `--config` option from `exists=False` to `exists=True`, but this is incorrect for the following reasons:\n\n1. **The bug description states that the issue occurs when an INVALID/NON-EXISTENT config file is specified** - the user wants exit code 2 when a config file doesn't exist, not exit code 1.\n\n2. **Setting `exists=True` will cause Click to validate file existence BEFORE the callback is executed** - this means the `read_pyproject_toml` callback function will never be called for non-existent files, so the custom error handling in that function (which should produce exit code 2) is bypassed.\n\n3. **Click's built-in file validation produces different error handling** - when `exists=True` and a file doesn't exist, Click will handle this with its own error mechanism, likely still producing exit code 1 instead of the desired exit code 2.\n\n4. **The test expects exit code 2** - the test in the description shows it expects `exit_code=2` when an invalid config file is provided, but this change would prevent the custom error handling that should produce that exit code.\n\nThe correct fix should keep `exists=False` and modify the error handling within the `read_pyproject_toml` callback function to ensure it raises an error that results in exit code 2, not change the Click option validation behavior."}
