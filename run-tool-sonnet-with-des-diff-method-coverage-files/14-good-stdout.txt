{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at the bug description, the issue is that `get_future_imports` fails when importing `__future__` with renaming (e.g., `from __future__ import absolute_import as _absolute_import`).\n\nLet me analyze the code diff:\n\n1. The original implementation only handled simple imports and basic `import_as_names` structures\n2. The new implementation adds a helper function `get_imports_from_children` that recursively handles:\n   - Simple `NAME` tokens (direct imports)\n   - `import_as_name` nodes (imports with aliases like `import_name as alias`)\n   - `import_as_names` nodes (multiple imports)\n\n3. The key improvement is in handling `import_as_name` nodes - when encountering one, it extracts the original name (before the `as` keyword) rather than failing or getting the alias name.\n\nLooking at the test file changes, it shows the function should work with:\n- `from __future__ import unicode_literals as _unicode_literals` \n- `from __future__ import print_function as lol, with_function`\n\nThe implementation correctly:\n1. Identifies `import_as_name` nodes and extracts `child.children[0]` (the original name)\n2. Handles multiple imports in `import_as_names` by recursively calling itself\n3. Maintains the same interface and return type (`Set[str]`)\n4. Preserves the original logic for detecting `__future__` imports\n\nThe fix addresses the exact issue described in the PR - it now properly handles aliased imports from `__future__` by extracting the original import name rather than failing on the syntax.\n\n**True** - This diff correctly fixes the bug by adding proper handling for aliased `__future__` imports while maintaining backward compatibility with existing functionality."}
