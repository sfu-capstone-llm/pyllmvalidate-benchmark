{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The diff is false because it fails to implement the core functionality described in the PR and issue.**\n\nThe PR title states \"Automatic detection of deprecated Python 2 forms of print and exec\" and Issue #49 specifically describes the problem where Black incorrectly adds spaces before parentheses for `exec` and `eval` functions, treating them as if they were still Python 2 statements rather than Python 3 functions.\n\nHowever, examining the diff reveals several critical problems:\n\n1. **Missing grammar definitions**: The diff adds new grammar variants in `blib2to3/pygram.py` but the actual file content shown doesn't include these new grammar definitions (`python_grammar_no_exec_statement` and `python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement`).\n\n2. **Incomplete parsing logic**: While the diff shows a `GRAMMARS` list and attempts to try multiple grammars in `lib2to3_parse()`, the implementation is incomplete and doesn't properly handle the grammar fallback mechanism.\n\n3. **Incorrect whitespace handling**: The diff adds a condition in the `whitespace()` function to handle \"Python 2 print chevron\" but this doesn't address the core issue described in Issue #49, which is about `exec` and `eval` function calls getting unwanted spaces.\n\n4. **Missing the actual fix**: The issue shows that Black incorrectly transforms `exec(\"code\", {}, {})` to `exec (\"code\", {}, {})` (adding a space), but the diff doesn't contain any logic to prevent this specific formatting behavior for `exec` and `eval` when they're used as functions rather than statements.\n\nThe test file changes show `exec(\"new-style exec\", {}, {})` being added, but without the proper grammar handling and whitespace logic, this won't prevent the unwanted space insertion that the issue describes.\n\nThe diff appears to be an incomplete attempt at the fix that doesn't actually solve the reported problem of Black adding spaces before parentheses for built-in functions like `exec` and `eval`."}
