{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The diff is false because it fundamentally breaks the logic of `generate_ignored_nodes`.**\n\nThe original function is designed to yield **all containers** from the current container up to the end of the block when `# fmt: off` is active. However, the patched version completely changes this behavior in a problematic way:\n\n1. **Incorrect early return**: The new code calls `return` when `contains_fmt_off_at_column(container, leaf.column)` is true, which means it stops processing entirely when it finds a `# fmt: off` at the same column. This is backwards - it should continue yielding nodes when `# fmt: off` is active, not stop.\n\n2. **Wrong yielding logic**: When the condition is true, it yields individual `child` nodes instead of the `container`, and when false, it yields the `container` but then incorrectly sets `container = container.next_sibling` instead of the proper `container.next_sibling` assignment that should happen in the main loop.\n\n3. **Broken control flow**: The original logic has a clear while loop that processes siblings sequentially. The patch breaks this by having inconsistent container advancement - sometimes advancing to `next_sibling`, sometimes not.\n\n4. **Missing main loop logic**: The patch removes the essential `container = container.next_sibling` from the main while loop, which means the loop will either infinite loop or terminate prematurely.\n\nThe correct approach would be to modify the existing logic to handle `# fmt: on` detection within the same indentation level, but the current patch completely restructures the function in a way that breaks its fundamental purpose of yielding ignored nodes in sequence until `# fmt: on` is encountered."}
