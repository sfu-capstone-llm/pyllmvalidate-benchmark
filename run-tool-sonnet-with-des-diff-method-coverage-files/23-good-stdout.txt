{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's **false** - it does not correctly fix the bug described in Issue #49.\n\n**The bug is false because it fails to address the core issue: preventing spaces before parentheses for built-in functions like `exec` and `print`.**\n\nHere's the analysis:\n\n## The Problem (Issue #49)\nThe issue reports that Black incorrectly adds spaces before parentheses for built-in functions:\n```python\n# Before (correct)\nreturn exec(\"code\", {}, {})\n\n# After Black formatting (incorrect)  \nreturn exec (\"code\", {}, {})\n```\n\n## What the Diff Actually Does\nThe diff makes two main changes:\n\n1. **Grammar parsing changes**: Adds multiple grammar variants to handle Python 2 `print` and `exec` statements, which is good for parsing compatibility.\n\n2. **Whitespace rule addition**: Adds a rule in the `whitespace()` function to detect Python 2 print chevron syntax (`print >>`) and return `NO` space.\n\n## Why It's False\nThe diff **completely misses the actual problem**. The issue is about **function calls** like `exec(\"code\")`, but the diff only handles:\n\n- Python 2 `print >>` chevron syntax (which is not the reported issue)\n- Grammar parsing improvements (which don't affect formatting)\n\nThe diff does **nothing** to prevent spaces before parentheses in function calls to `exec`, `eval`, `print()`, etc.\n\n## What's Missing\nThe fix should include logic in the `whitespace()` function to detect when the previous token is a built-in function name (like `exec`, `eval`, `print`) and the current token is an opening parenthesis, then return `NO` space.\n\n## Evidence from Test Files\nLooking at the test file, we can see:\n```python\nexec(\"new-style exec\", {}, {})  # This should remain without space\n```\n\nBut there's no logic in the diff that would specifically handle this case - the added whitespace rule only handles the `print >>` chevron case, not function calls.\n\nThe diff is a false fix because it addresses Python 2 compatibility and print chevron syntax, but ignores the core issue of spacing before parentheses in built-in function calls."}
