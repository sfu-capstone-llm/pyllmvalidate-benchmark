{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately see why it's incorrect.\n\n**The diff is false because it breaks the logic for detecting async function definitions.**\n\nHere's the problem:\n\nThe original code correctly identifies `async def` patterns by checking:\n```python\nif token == 'def':\n    if (stashed and stashed[0] == NAME and stashed[1] == 'async'):\n        # Handle async def\n```\n\nThe diff changes this to:\n```python\nif token == 'def' or token == 'for':\n    if (stashed and stashed[0] == NAME and stashed[1] == 'async'):\n        # Handle async def\n```\n\nThis change is fundamentally flawed because:\n\n1. **It conflates two different syntax constructs**: `async def` (async function definition) and `async for` (async iteration in comprehensions/generators)\n\n2. **It incorrectly treats `async for` as `async def`**: When the tokenizer encounters `async for`, it will now set `async_def = True` and `async_def_indent`, which are specifically meant for tracking async function definitions, not async generators or comprehensions.\n\n3. **It doesn't actually fix async generator parsing**: The issue #125 is about parsing `return (i * 2 async for i in arange(n))` - an async generator expression. This requires different tokenization logic than what's being modified here.\n\n4. **It will cause incorrect token emission**: The code will emit `ASYNC` tokens in the wrong contexts and set async function tracking state when encountering async generators, leading to parsing errors.\n\nThe correct fix for async generator expressions would need to handle the `async for` construct within comprehensions/generators differently, not by treating it the same as `async def` function definitions. The current change conflates two distinct Python language features that require separate handling in the tokenizer."}
