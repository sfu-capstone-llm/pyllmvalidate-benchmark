{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's false:\n\n**The diff incorrectly fixes the bug because it adds trailing commas to ALL function definitions with single arguments, not just those that are already formatted across multiple lines.**\n\nHere's the specific issue:\n\n1. **The original bug**: Functions with one argument that are already split across multiple lines should keep their trailing comma, but Black was removing it.\n\n2. **What the diff does wrong**: The `no_commas` logic in `bracket_split_build_line()` adds trailing commas to ANY function definition (`original.is_def`) that doesn't already have commas, regardless of whether the function was originally formatted across multiple lines.\n\n3. **The incorrect behavior**: This means a single-line function like `def one(a):` would get transformed to `def one(a,):` which is not the intended behavior. The trailing comma should only be preserved/added when the function arguments are already split across multiple lines.\n\n4. **Missing context check**: The fix doesn't check if the original function was formatted across multiple lines. It should only add trailing commas when the function arguments span multiple lines, similar to how `original.is_import` works for import statements.\n\nThe correct fix should check whether the function definition was originally formatted across multiple lines before deciding to add a trailing comma, rather than adding it to all single-argument functions regardless of their original formatting."}
