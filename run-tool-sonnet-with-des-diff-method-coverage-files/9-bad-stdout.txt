{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately see the issue. The diff is **incorrect** because it changes the wrong grammar selection logic.\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThe diff changes line 735 from:\n```python\nreturn [pygram.python_grammar]\n```\nto:\n```python\nreturn [pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement]\n```\n\nThis is backwards! Here's why this is wrong:\n\n1. **The condition on line 728** checks `if all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)` - this means \"if ALL target versions are NOT Python 2\" (i.e., all are Python 3+)\n\n2. **The `else` clause (line 734)** handles the case where at least one target version IS Python 2\n\n3. **For Python 2 compatibility**, you need the full `pygram.python_grammar` which includes the print statement syntax, not `pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement` which excludes it\n\n4. **The bug described in issue #752** shows that with `--target-version py27`, Black was incorrectly adding whitespace around `print()` calls. This happens because the wrong grammar was being used - it was treating `print` as a function when it should recognize it as a statement in Python 2.\n\n**The Correct Fix Should Be:**\n\nThe problem is actually in the Python 3+ branch (lines 729-733), not the Python 2 branch. When targeting Python 3+, Black should use grammars that don't include print statement syntax, but when targeting Python 2, it should use the full grammar that includes print statements.\n\nThe current diff makes the Python 2 case use a grammar without print statements, which is exactly the opposite of what's needed to fix the issue."}
