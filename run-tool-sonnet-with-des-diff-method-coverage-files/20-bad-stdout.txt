{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify the issue:\n\n**The diff is incorrect because it has a bug in the destination name assignment.**\n\nIn the diff, line 345 shows:\n```python\ndst_name = f\"{src}  (original)\"\n```\n\nBut it should be:\n```python\ndst_name = f\"{src}  (formatted)\"\n```\n\nThe bug is that both `src_name` and `dst_name` are being set to `\"(original)\"` when `dst_name` should be `\"(formatted)\"`. This would result in diff output showing:\n\n```\n--- path/to/file.py  (original)\n+++ path/to/file.py  (original)\n```\n\nInstead of the correct:\n```\n--- path/to/file.py  (original)\n+++ path/to/file.py  (formatted)\n```\n\nWhile the diff correctly addresses the main issue from the GitHub issue #130 (showing full file paths by using `{src}` instead of `{src.name}`), it introduces a new bug by incorrectly labeling both the source and destination with \"(original)\".\n\nThe correct fix should be:\n```python\nsrc_name = f\"{src}  (original)\"\ndst_name = f\"{src}  (formatted)\"\n```\n\nThis would properly show the full path (fixing issue #130) while maintaining the correct labels to distinguish between the original and formatted versions of the file."}
