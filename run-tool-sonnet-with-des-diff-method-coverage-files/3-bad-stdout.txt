{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately see that **this diff is false** - it does not fix the bug described in the PR and issue.\n\n## Why this diff is incorrect:\n\nThe diff shows no actual changes to the code:\n\n```diff\n@click.option(\n    \"--config\",\n    type=click.Path(\n-        exists=False, file_okay=True, dir_okay=False, readable=True, allow_dash=False\n+        exists=False, file_okay=True, dir_okay=False, readable=True, allow_dash=False\n    ),\n    is_eager=True,\n    callback=read_pyproject_toml,\n```\n\nThe lines marked with `-` and `+` are identical - there is no actual modification to the code. This is essentially a no-op change.\n\n## What the bug requires:\n\nAccording to the PR description and Issue #1360, the problem is that when an invalid config file is specified (like a non-existent file), Black returns exit code 1 instead of exit code 2. The expected behavior is:\n\n- Exit code 0: Nothing would change\n- Exit code 1: Some files would be reformatted  \n- Exit code 2: Bad parameters (like invalid config file)\n- Exit code 123: Internal error\n\n## What should be fixed:\n\nThe issue is in the `read_pyproject_toml` function where it catches `OSError` (which includes \"file not found\" errors) and raises a `click.FileError`. However, `click.FileError` results in exit code 1, not 2.\n\nTo fix this properly, the code should either:\n1. Set `exists=True` in the `click.Path()` parameters to make Click validate file existence upfront (which would give exit code 2), or\n2. Modify the error handling in `read_pyproject_toml` to raise a different exception that results in exit code 2\n\nSince this diff makes no actual changes, it cannot possibly fix the exit code issue described in the bug report."}
