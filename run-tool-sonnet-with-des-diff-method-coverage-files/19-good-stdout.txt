{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this git diff, I can immediately identify why it's **false** - the fix is **incorrect**.\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe diff adds this condition:\n\n```python\nif is_decorator and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_comment:\n    # Don't insert empty lines between decorator comments.\n    return 0, 0\n```\n\nThis condition is **too broad** and misunderstands the actual issue. Let me explain:\n\n## Why This Fix Is Wrong\n\n1. **Misidentifies the problem**: The issue isn't about \"decorator comments\" - it's about **comments that appear between decorators**. In the example:\n   ```python\n   @property\n   # TODO: X\n   @property\n   def foo():\n       pass\n   ```\n   The comment `# TODO: X` is between two decorators, not a \"decorator comment\".\n\n2. **Wrong condition logic**: The condition `is_decorator and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_comment` would trigger when:\n   - Current line is a decorator (`@property`)\n   - Previous line is a comment (`# TODO: X`)\n   \n   But this doesn't specifically address the case where the comment is **between decorators**.\n\n3. **Too restrictive**: This fix would prevent blank lines between ANY decorator and ANY preceding comment, which could affect legitimate cases where blank lines should be preserved.\n\n## What The Fix Should Actually Do\n\nThe correct fix should:\n1. Detect when a comment line appears between two decorators\n2. Only in that specific case, prevent adding blank lines after the comment\n3. The current fix tries to prevent blank lines before the second decorator, but the real issue is blank lines being added after the comment line\n\nThe bug description shows that Black is adding blank lines **after** the comment `# TODO: X`, not before the second `@property`. The fix should target the comment line processing, not the decorator line processing.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis diff is **false** because it applies the wrong logic at the wrong place and would have unintended side effects on legitimate decorator-comment combinations that aren't between decorators."}
