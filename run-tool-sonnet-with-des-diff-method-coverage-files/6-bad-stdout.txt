{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can see that it's attempting to fix the issue with parsing async/await keywords in Python 3.7+ generator expressions. However, there's a critical bug in the implementation.\n\n**The code diff is FALSE.**\n\nThe main issue is in the `blib2to3/pgen2/tokenize.py` file at line 517:\n\n```python\nif async_is_reserved_keyword and async_def:\n```\n\nThis condition is **too restrictive**. The problem is that it only treats `async` and `await` as keywords when both conditions are true:\n1. `async_is_reserved_keyword` is True (Python 3.7+)\n2. `async_def` is True (inside an async function)\n\nHowever, according to the bug description and the failing test, the issue is that `await` should be treated as a keyword in generator expressions even when NOT inside an async function. The example from the issue shows:\n\n```python\ndef make_arange(n):  # This is NOT an async function\n    return (i * 2 for i in range(n) if await wrap(i))  # But await should still be a keyword here\n```\n\nThe fix should be:\n\n```python\nif async_is_reserved_keyword or async_def:\n```\n\nThis would ensure that in Python 3.7+, `async` and `await` are always treated as reserved keywords, regardless of whether we're inside an async function or not. The current implementation with `and` means that `await` in the generator expression won't be tokenized as a keyword because `async_def` is False (since `make_arange` is not an async function), which is exactly the bug that needs to be fixed.\n\nThe test failure confirms this - it's trying to parse `await` in a regular function's generator expression and failing because `await` isn't being recognized as a keyword."}
