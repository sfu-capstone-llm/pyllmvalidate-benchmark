{"is_correct": true, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately see that it correctly fixes the bug described in the GitHub issue.\n\n**This git diff is correct because it properly implements support for always tokenizing async/await as keywords in Python 3.7+.**\n\nHere's why this fix is correct:\n\n## The Problem\nThe issue was that Black couldn't parse new Python 3.7 async generator syntax like:\n```python\ndef make_arange(n):\n    return (i * 2 for i in range(n) if await wrap(i))\n```\n\nThis failed because the tokenizer couldn't determine when `async`/`await` should be treated as keywords vs identifiers in all contexts, particularly inside generators.\n\n## The Solution\nThe diff introduces a **tokenizer configuration approach** that allows specifying whether `async`/`await` should always be treated as reserved keywords:\n\n1. **New TokenizerConfig class** in `blib2to3/pgen2/tokenize.py`:\n   ```python\n   @dataclass(frozen=True)\n   class TokenizerConfig:\n       async_is_reserved_keyword: bool = False\n   ```\n\n2. **Feature flags** to distinguish Python versions:\n   - `ASYNC_IS_VALID_IDENTIFIER` for Python 2.7-3.6\n   - `ASYNC_IS_RESERVED_KEYWORD` for Python 3.7+\n\n3. **Parser configuration system** that tries different tokenizer configs based on target Python versions:\n   - For Python 3.7+: `TokenizerConfig(async_is_reserved_keyword=True)`\n   - For Python 3.0-3.6: `TokenizerConfig(async_is_reserved_keyword=False)`\n\n4. **Updated tokenizer logic** in `generate_tokens()`:\n   ```python\n   if token in ('async', 'await'):\n       if async_is_reserved_keyword or async_def:\n           yield (ASYNC if token == 'async' else AWAIT, token, spos, epos, line)\n           continue\n   ```\n\n## Why This Works\n- **Version-aware parsing**: The system tries parsing with the appropriate tokenizer config based on target Python versions\n- **Fallback mechanism**: If parsing fails with one config, it tries others\n- **Preserves backward compatibility**: Older Python versions still work correctly\n- **Handles the specific case**: The problematic `await` in generator expressions is now properly tokenized as a keyword in Python 3.7+ mode\n\n## Evidence of Correctness\nThe test file `tests/data/python37.py` shows the exact problematic code from the issue is now handled correctly:\n```python\ndef make_arange(n):\n    return (i * 2 for i in range(n) if await wrap(i))\n```\n\nThis approach elegantly solves the core problem: **it's not possible for the tokenizer to determine if async/await is a keyword in all contexts without knowing the Python version**, so the fix introduces explicit version-aware tokenizer configuration."}
