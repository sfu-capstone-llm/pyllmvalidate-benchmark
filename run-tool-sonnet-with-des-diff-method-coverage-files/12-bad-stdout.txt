{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at the bug description and the code diff, I need to analyze whether the fix correctly addresses the issue with lambda expressions containing default arguments.\n\nThe issue is that Black fails to format this code:\n```python\npem_spam = lambda l, spam = {\n    \"-----BEGIN PKCS7-----\": True, \"-----END PKCS7-----\": True, \"\": True\n}: not spam.get(l.strip())\n```\n\nThe problem is in the `BracketTracker` class which tracks bracket depth for proper formatting. The original code used simple integer counters (`_for_loop_variable` and `_lambda_arguments`) to track nesting levels, but this approach fails when there are nested structures.\n\nLooking at the diff:\n\n1. **Problem**: The original code used simple counters that would be decremented incorrectly when encountering nested lambda expressions or for loops.\n\n2. **Solution**: The fix changes from simple integer counters to lists that track the depth at which each lambda/for-loop starts:\n   - `_for_loop_variable: int = 0` \u2192 `_for_loop_depths: List[int] = Factory(list)`\n   - `_lambda_arguments: int = 0` \u2192 `_lambda_argument_depths: List[int] = Factory(list)`\n\n3. **Key changes**:\n   - When encountering `lambda`, it appends the current depth to `_lambda_argument_depths`\n   - When encountering `:` (end of lambda args), it checks if the current depth matches the most recent lambda depth before decrementing\n   - Similar logic for for-loops with `for`/`in` keywords\n\n4. **The fix addresses the core issue**: In the problematic code, the lambda has a default argument that contains a dictionary with nested brackets. The original simple counter approach would incorrectly track the bracket depth, but the new list-based approach correctly tracks which depth level each lambda started at.\n\nThe fix correctly handles nested structures by maintaining a stack of depths rather than a simple counter, ensuring that bracket depth adjustments only happen at the appropriate nesting level.\n\n**True** - This diff correctly fixes the bug by replacing simple counters with depth-tracking lists that properly handle nested bracket structures in lambda expressions with default arguments."}
