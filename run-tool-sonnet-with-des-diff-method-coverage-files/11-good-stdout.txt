{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff and the description, I need to analyze whether the fix correctly addresses the issue with multiline function type annotation comments.\n\nThe issue is that Black was incorrectly combining multiline function parameters with type comments into a single line, which creates malformed type annotations like:\n```python\ndef f(a, b, c):  # type: int  # type: str  # type: bool  # type: (...) -> None\n```\n\nThe diff adds logic to detect \"special comments\" (specifically type comments) and prevents line splitting when such comments are present on comma-separated parameters.\n\nLet me examine the key changes:\n\n1. **New function `is_special_comment()`**: Correctly identifies type comments by checking if the comment starts with \"# type:\"\n\n2. **Modified `split_line()` function**: \n   - Adds logic to detect if any leaf has special comments after commas\n   - Sets `has_special_comment = True` when found\n   - Prevents splitting when `has_special_comment` is True\n\n3. **The detection logic**:\n   ```python\n   has_special_comment = False\n   for leaf in line.leaves:\n       for comment in line.comments_after(leaf):\n           if leaf.type == token.COMMA and is_special_comment(comment):\n               has_special_comment = True\n   ```\n\nThis logic correctly identifies when a comma token has a type comment after it, which is exactly the pattern that was causing the malformed output.\n\nThe fix prevents Black from collapsing multiline function signatures that have per-parameter type comments, which preserves the valid type annotation format as required by PEP 484.\n\n**True** - This diff correctly fixes the bug by detecting type comments after comma tokens and preventing line splitting in those cases, which maintains the valid multiline type annotation format."}
