{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can see that it attempts to handle the case where `ProcessPoolExecutor` fails to initialize due to system limitations (like in AWS Lambda environments). However, **this diff is incorrect** and will not properly fix the bug.\n\n## Why this diff is wrong:\n\n1. **Incorrect fallback logic**: When the `OSError` is caught, the code tries to create another `ProcessPoolExecutor()` with no arguments:\n   ```python\n   except OSError:\n       # we arrive here if the underlying system does not support multi-processing\n       # like in AWS Lambda, in which case we gracefully fallback to the default\n       # mono-process Executor by using None\n       executor = ProcessPoolExecutor()  # This will fail again!\n   ```\n   This will just trigger the same `OSError` again since the underlying system issue hasn't been resolved.\n\n2. **Wrong executor type**: The comment says \"fallback to the default mono-process Executor by using None\" but the code creates another `ProcessPoolExecutor()`, not a single-process executor.\n\n3. **Incomplete shutdown handling**: The code changes the shutdown logic to:\n   ```python\n   if executor is not None:\n       pass  # Does nothing!\n   ```\n   This doesn't actually shut down the executor properly.\n\n4. **Missing actual fallback**: The code doesn't implement the promised fallback to single-threaded processing. It should either:\n   - Use `ThreadPoolExecutor` with 1 worker, or  \n   - Process files sequentially without any executor\n\n## What the correct fix should do:\n\nThe fix should catch the `OSError` and either:\n1. Set `executor = None` and modify `schedule_formatting` to handle sequential processing when `executor` is `None`\n2. Use a `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1)` as a fallback\n3. Call `reformat_one` for each file sequentially\n\nThe current diff will still crash with the same `OSError` when trying to create the second `ProcessPoolExecutor()`, making it ineffective at solving the AWS Lambda compatibility issue."}
