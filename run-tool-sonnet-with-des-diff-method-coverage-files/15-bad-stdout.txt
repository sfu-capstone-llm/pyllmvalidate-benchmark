{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this git diff, I can see that it's attempting to fix the `# fmt: off` issue by removing the exception-based handling and implementing a separate pass approach. However, **this diff is incorrect** because it fundamentally breaks the `# fmt: off`/`# fmt: on` functionality.\n\n## Why this diff is wrong:\n\n1. **Removes all fmt control logic from comment processing**: The diff removes the `FormatOff` and `FormatOn` exception classes and all the exception-based handling in `generate_comments()`. This means that `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` comments are now treated as regular comments instead of formatting control directives.\n\n2. **The new approach doesn't actually work**: While the diff adds `normalize_fmt_off()` and `convert_one_fmt_off_pair()` functions, these functions only convert content between `# fmt: off`/`# fmt: on` into standalone comments. This doesn't prevent the formatter from processing the code - it just hides it in comments, which is not the intended behavior.\n\n3. **Missing integration**: The `normalize_fmt_off()` function is called in `format_str()`, but this happens after the code has already been parsed and before the line generation. The issue is that the line generation process (`LineGenerator.visit()`) no longer has any awareness of fmt control comments, so it will still format everything.\n\n4. **Breaks the core functionality**: The original issue was that `# fmt: off` was being ignored after the first function. This diff doesn't fix that - it completely removes the mechanism that makes `# fmt: off` work at all.\n\nThe correct approach would be to:\n- Keep some form of fmt control awareness in the line generation process\n- Fix the boundary issues that caused fmt control to not work across statement boundaries\n- Ensure that the fmt control state is properly maintained throughout the entire file processing\n\nThis diff represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how the fmt control should work and would break the feature entirely rather than fixing the boundary issue described in the GitHub issue."}
