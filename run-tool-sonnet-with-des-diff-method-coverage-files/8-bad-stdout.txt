{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at the bug description and the code diff, I need to analyze whether the fix correctly handles comments in from imports.\n\nThe issue is that Black was producing invalid code when formatting multi-line imports with commented out lines. The problem was that Black was adding a trailing comma after comments, which is syntactically invalid.\n\nLooking at the diff:\n\n**Original code:**\n```python\nif original.is_import:\n    if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:\n        leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, \",\"))\n```\n\n**Fixed code:**\n```python\nif original.is_import:\n    for i in range(len(leaves) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if leaves[i].type == token.COMMA:\n            break\n        elif leaves[i].type == STANDALONE_COMMENT:\n            continue\n        else:\n            leaves.insert(i + 1, Leaf(token.COMMA, \",\"))\n            break\n```\n\nThe fix changes the logic to:\n1. Iterate backwards through the leaves\n2. If it finds a comma, stop (no need to add another)\n3. If it finds a standalone comment, skip it and continue looking\n4. If it finds any other type of leaf, insert a comma after it and stop\n\nThis ensures that trailing commas are added after the last non-comment element, not after comments, which would be invalid syntax.\n\nLooking at the test case from the issue:\n```python\nfrom .config import (\n    Any,\n    Bool,\n    ConfigType,\n    ConfigTypeAttributes,\n    Int,\n    Path,\n    #  String,\n    #  resolve_to_config_type,\n    #  DEFAULT_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES,\n)\n```\n\nWith the original code, it would try to add a comma after the last comment, producing invalid syntax. With the fix, it will find the last non-comment element (`Path`) and add the comma after it, which is correct.\n\nThe fix correctly addresses the bug by ensuring trailing commas are only added after actual import elements, not after comments.\n\n**True** - The code diff correctly fixes the bug by properly handling comments in from imports and ensuring trailing commas are placed after the last non-comment import element rather than after comments."}
