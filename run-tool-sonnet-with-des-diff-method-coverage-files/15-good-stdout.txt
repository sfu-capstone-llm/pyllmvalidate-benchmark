{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at the bug description and code diff, I need to analyze whether the changes correctly fix the issue where `# fmt: off` is ignored after the first function.\n\nThe issue describes that `# fmt: off` comments are being ignored after the first function, with formatting still being applied when it shouldn't be. The PR description states this \"removes the hacky exception-based handling that didn't work across statement boundaries.\"\n\nLooking at the diff, I can see:\n\n1. **Removed exception-based handling**: The code removes `FormatError`, `FormatOn`, and `FormatOff` exception classes and the `UnformattedLines` class that were used for the old approach.\n\n2. **New approach**: Instead of using exceptions, the code now uses a separate pass (`normalize_fmt_off`) that converts content between `# fmt: off`/`# fmt: on` into standalone comments.\n\n3. **Key changes in the visitor**: The `visit_default` method no longer has try-catch blocks for `FormatOff`/`FormatOn` exceptions and instead processes comments normally.\n\n4. **New functions**: `convert_one_fmt_off_pair` and `generate_ignored_nodes` implement the new logic to find and convert fmt:off regions into standalone comments.\n\nThe new approach works by:\n- Finding `# fmt: off` comments\n- Collecting all nodes until `# fmt: on` \n- Converting the entire region into a single standalone comment\n- This prevents the formatter from processing the content\n\nThis approach should work across statement boundaries because it operates on the AST level before the line-by-line formatting begins, rather than trying to handle it during the formatting process with exceptions.\n\nThe test case in the issue shows that content after functions was being reformatted despite `# fmt: off`, and this new approach should preserve that content by converting it to comments before formatting starts.\n\n**True** - This code diff correctly fixes the bug. The new approach of converting `# fmt: off`/`# fmt: on` regions into standalone comments at the AST level before formatting begins is a much more robust solution than the previous exception-based approach that failed across statement boundaries."}
