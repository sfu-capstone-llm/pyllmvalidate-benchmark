{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's **false** - the diff has a critical logical error in the condition that determines when to avoid splitting lines with special comments.\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe diff adds this condition:\n```python\nif (\n    has_special_comment\n    and not line.should_explode\n    and is_line_short_enough(line, line_length=line_length, line_str=line_str)\n):\n    yield line\n    return\n```\n\nHowever, this condition is **backwards**. According to the issue description, the problem occurs when Black combines multiline function parameters with type comments onto a single line, creating malformed type annotations like:\n\n```python\ndef f(a, b, c):  # type: int  # type: str  # type: bool  # type: (...) -> None\n```\n\nThe issue states that when type comments are present on separate lines, Black should either:\n1. Leave the function parameters on separate lines (do nothing), OR  \n2. Restructure the type annotation properly\n\n## Why This Fix is Wrong\n\nThe current condition `is_line_short_enough(line, line_length=line_length, line_str=line_str)` means:\n- **When the line IS short enough** \u2192 Don't split (yield the line as-is)\n- **When the line is TOO long** \u2192 Continue with normal splitting logic\n\nBut this is the opposite of what's needed! The problem described in the issue occurs when:\n1. You have multiline parameters with individual type comments\n2. The combined line would fit within the line length limit  \n3. Black incorrectly combines them into one malformed line\n\nThe fix should prevent splitting **when the line is too long** (to preserve the multiline format with individual type comments), not when it's short enough.\n\n## The Correct Logic Should Be\n\n```python\nif (\n    has_special_comment\n    and not line.should_explode\n    and NOT is_line_short_enough(line, line_length=line_length, line_str=line_str)\n):\n    yield line\n    return\n```\n\nOr alternatively, the condition should check if combining the parameters would create malformed type annotations and prevent that specific case.\n\nThe current diff will actually make the problem worse by preventing splits in cases where they might be beneficial, while still allowing the problematic behavior described in the issue."}
