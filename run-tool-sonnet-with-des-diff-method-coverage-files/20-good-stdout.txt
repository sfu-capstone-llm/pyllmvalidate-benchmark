{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at the bug description and the code diff:\n\n**Bug Description**: The issue is that `--diff` doesn't display the full file path. Currently it shows just the filename (e.g., `foo.py`) instead of the full path (e.g., `path/to/foo.py`).\n\n**Code Diff Analysis**: The diff changes lines 344-345 in the `format_file_in_place` function:\n\n```python\n# Before (using src.name - just filename)\nsrc_name = f\"{src.name}  (original)\"\ndst_name = f\"{src.name}  (formatted)\"\n\n# After (using src - full path)\nsrc_name = f\"{src}  (original)\"\ndst_name = f\"{src}  (formatted)\"\n```\n\n**Verification**: \n- `src` is a `Path` object representing the full file path\n- `src.name` returns only the filename portion of the path\n- Using `str(src)` (which happens when `src` is used in an f-string) returns the full path\n- This change directly addresses the issue described in the PR/Issue where users want to see full paths in diff output for better readability, especially when dealing with files in different directories with the same name\n\nThe fix correctly changes from using `src.name` (filename only) to `src` (full path) in the diff header generation, which matches the requirement to show full paths in `--diff` output.\n\n**Answer: True**\n\nThe code diff correctly fixes the bug by replacing `src.name` with `src` in the diff header generation, which changes the output from showing just the filename to showing the complete file path as requested in the issue."}
