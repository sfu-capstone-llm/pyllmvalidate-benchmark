{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The diff is false because it only partially implements async generator support.**\n\nThe key issue is in this section of the diff:\n\n```python\nif token in ('def', 'for'):\n    if (stashed\n            and stashed[0] == NAME\n            and stashed[1] == 'async'):\n\n        if token == 'def':  # Only sets async_def for 'def', not 'for'\n            async_def = True\n            async_def_indent = indents[-1]\n\n        yield (ASYNC, stashed[1],\n               stashed[2], stashed[3],\n               stashed[4])\n        stashed = None\n```\n\n**The problem:** While the code now correctly recognizes `async for` constructs (by checking for both 'def' and 'for' tokens after an 'async' token), it only sets the `async_def` and `async_def_indent` variables when the token is 'def'. \n\n**Why this matters:** The `async_def` flag and related variables are used throughout the tokenizer to handle async context properly, including:\n1. Determining when to emit `ASYNC`/`AWAIT` tokens vs `NAME` tokens\n2. Managing indentation levels for async blocks\n3. Handling newlines in async contexts\n\n**The consequence:** For async generators like `(i * 2 async for i in arange(n))`, the tokenizer will:\n1. Correctly identify the `async for` pattern\n2. Emit the `ASYNC` token for 'async'\n3. But fail to set up the proper async context state\n4. This leads to incorrect tokenization of subsequent `async`/`await` keywords within the generator expression\n\n**What should happen:** When `token == 'for'` and there's a stashed 'async', the code should also set up appropriate async context state, similar to how it handles `async def`.\n\nThe fix addresses the parsing issue mentioned in Issue #125 only superficially - it recognizes the syntax but doesn't handle the async context properly, which could lead to incorrect tokenization in more complex cases involving nested async constructs."}
