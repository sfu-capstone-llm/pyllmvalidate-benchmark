{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The diff is false because it changes the behavior for `--diff` and stdout output, which contradicts the PR description.**\n\nThe PR description explicitly states:\n> \"Note that this only changes behavior when black writes back to the file. In other cases like when using --diff or writing to stdout, I think it's reasonable to expect the caller to handle line endings.\"\n\nHowever, the diff modifies both:\n\n1. **DIFF output** (lines 486-499): The code wraps `sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)` with `io.TextIOWrapper` using the detected newline format, which means DIFF output will now preserve line endings instead of using the system default.\n\n2. **Stdout output** (lines 523-544): Similarly, `format_stdin_to_stdout` now preserves line endings when writing to stdout, both for normal output and diff output.\n\nThe correct implementation should:\n- \u2705 Preserve line endings when writing back to files (`write_back == WriteBack.YES`)\n- \u274c **NOT** preserve line endings for `--diff` output \n- \u274c **NOT** preserve line endings for stdout output\n\nThe diff incorrectly implements line ending preservation for all output modes, when it should only apply to file write-back operations. This violates the explicit requirement in the PR description that diff and stdout output should continue using system defaults for line endings."}
