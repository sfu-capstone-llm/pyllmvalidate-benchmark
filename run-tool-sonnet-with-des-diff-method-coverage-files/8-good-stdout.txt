{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at the bug description and the code diff, I need to analyze whether the fix correctly handles comments in from imports.\n\nThe issue is that Black was producing invalid code when there were commented out lines in multi-line imports. The problem was that Black was adding a trailing comma after comments, which is syntactically invalid.\n\nLooking at the diff:\n\n**Original code:**\n```python\nif original.is_import:\n    if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:\n        leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, \",\"))\n```\n\n**Fixed code:**\n```python\nif original.is_import:\n    for i in range(len(leaves) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if leaves[i].type == STANDALONE_COMMENT:\n            continue\n        elif leaves[i].type == token.COMMA:\n            break\n        else:\n            leaves.insert(i + 1, Leaf(token.COMMA, \",\"))\n            break\n```\n\nThe fix:\n1. Iterates backwards through the leaves\n2. Skips standalone comments\n3. If it finds a comma, it stops (no need to add another)\n4. If it finds a non-comment, non-comma element, it inserts a comma after that element and stops\n\nThis correctly handles the case where there are comments at the end of import statements by ensuring the trailing comma is placed after the last actual import item, not after any trailing comments.\n\nThe test case from the issue shows:\n```python\nfrom .config import (\n    Any,\n    Bool,\n    ConfigType,\n    ConfigTypeAttributes,\n    Int,\n    Path,\n    #  String,\n    #  resolve_to_config_type,\n    #  DEFAULT_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES,\n)\n```\n\nWith the original code, it would try to add a comma after the comments, creating invalid syntax. With the fix, it would add the comma after `Path,` (or not add one if there already is one), which is correct.\n\n**True** - This diff correctly fixes the bug by ensuring trailing commas are placed after the last actual import item rather than after any trailing comments, preventing the generation of invalid Python syntax."}
