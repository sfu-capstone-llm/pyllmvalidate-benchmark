{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this git diff, I can immediately see that **this fix is incorrect**.\n\nThe diff changes the encoding from `utf-8` to `latin1`:\n\n```python\nwith tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(\n-    mode=\"w\", prefix=\"blk_\", suffix=\".log\", delete=False\n+    mode=\"w\", prefix=\"blk_\", suffix=\".log\", delete=False, encoding=\"latin1\"\n) as f:\n```\n\n**Why this is wrong:**\n\n1. **Wrong encoding choice**: The issue description clearly shows the problem is with Unicode characters (`'\\u0142'` - which is the Polish letter \"\u0142\") that cannot be encoded in Windows' default cp1252 encoding. The solution should be to use `utf-8` encoding, not `latin1`.\n\n2. **latin1 limitations**: While `latin1` can encode the specific character `'\\u0142'` (\u0142), it's a very limited encoding that only covers the first 256 Unicode code points. This \"fix\" would fail for many other Unicode characters that are perfectly valid in Python source code.\n\n3. **Inconsistent with best practices**: UTF-8 is the standard encoding for handling Unicode text and should be the default choice for temporary files containing potentially international text.\n\n4. **PR title contradiction**: The PR title says \"Open temporary files with utf-8 encoding\" but the actual change uses `latin1`.\n\n**The correct fix should be:**\n```python\nencoding=\"utf-8\"\n```\n\nThis would properly handle all Unicode characters that might appear in Python source code, not just the specific Polish character that triggered this bug report."}
