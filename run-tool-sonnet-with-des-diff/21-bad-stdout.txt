{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **incorrect** and does not properly fix the bug.\n\n**Reason:** The diff changes the encoding from the default (which causes cp1252 on Windows) to \"latin1\", but this is the wrong encoding choice. \n\nThe PR title clearly states \"Open temporary files with utf-8 encoding\" and the issue shows a `UnicodeEncodeError` when trying to encode the character '\\u0142' (which is the Polish letter \u0142). The proper fix should use `encoding=\"utf-8\"` to handle Unicode characters correctly, not `encoding=\"latin1\"`.\n\nLatin-1 encoding can only represent characters in the range U+0000 to U+00FF, so it would still fail to encode the problematic character '\\u0142' (U+0142), just with a different error. UTF-8 encoding is needed to properly handle the full range of Unicode characters present in the test files.\n\nThe correct fix should be:\n```python\nmode=\"w\", prefix=\"blk_\", suffix=\".log\", delete=False, encoding=\"utf-8\"\n```"}
