{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **false** because it contains a critical bug in the fix.\n\n**Reason:** The diff incorrectly sets both `src_name` and `dst_name` to the same value `f\"{src}  (original)\"`. The `dst_name` should be `f\"{src}  (formatted)\"` to properly distinguish between the original and formatted versions of the file in the diff output.\n\nThe correct fix should be:\n```python\nsrc_name = f\"{src}  (original)\"\ndst_name = f\"{src}  (formatted)\"  # Not (original)\n```\n\nWhile the diff does address the main issue of showing the full path (by using `{src}` instead of `{src.name}`), it introduces a new bug where both the \"before\" and \"after\" sections of the diff would be labeled as \"(original)\", making the diff output confusing and incorrect."}
