{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **false** because it incorrectly implements the trailing comma logic for function definitions.\n\nThe main issue is with the `no_commas` condition:\n\n```python\nno_commas = original.is_def and not any(\n    l.type == token.COMMA for l in leaves\n)\n```\n\nThis condition checks if there are **no commas at all** in the leaves, but according to the bug description, the problem is specifically about functions with **one argument that already has a trailing comma**. The expected behavior is:\n\n- Functions with one argument should **keep** their trailing comma\n- Functions with multiple arguments should **remove** trailing commas\n\nHowever, this implementation would:\n1. Only add trailing commas when there are no commas present (which wouldn't help the case where a single-argument function already has a trailing comma)\n2. Not properly distinguish between single-argument and multi-argument functions\n3. Apply the same trailing comma logic to all function definitions regardless of argument count\n\nThe correct fix should:\n1. Detect when a function has exactly one argument\n2. Preserve the trailing comma in that specific case\n3. Remove trailing commas for multi-argument functions\n\nThe current diff doesn't address the core issue described in the bug report and would likely cause incorrect behavior."}
