{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **incorrect** and does not fix the bug.\n\n**Reason:** The diff changes the wrong grammar selection logic and introduces a new bug while failing to address the original issue.\n\n**Problems with this diff:**\n\n1. **Wrong grammar selection**: The diff changes `return [pygram.python_grammar]` to `return [pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement]` in the `else` branch. This means when targeting Python 2 (`py27`), it will use a grammar that doesn't support print statements, which is incorrect since Python 2 uses print as a statement by default.\n\n2. **Doesn't address the root cause**: The bug is about Black adding unnecessary whitespace around `print()` when `--target-version py27` is used with `from __future__ import print_function`. The issue is not in grammar selection but in how Black formats the `print()` function call when it detects Python 2 target version.\n\n3. **Comment inconsistency**: The comment is changed from \"Python 2-compatible code\" to \"Python 3-compatible code\" but the logic condition remains the same (`all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)`), creating confusion.\n\n4. **Missing the actual fix**: The real issue is that Black should recognize when `from __future__ import print_function` is present and treat `print()` as a function call rather than applying Python 2 print statement formatting rules. This diff doesn't address that logic at all.\n\nThe correct fix would need to handle the case where `print` is imported as a function from `__future__` and ensure it's formatted as a function call without extra whitespace, regardless of the target version."}
