{"is_correct": true, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can confirm that **this fix correctly addresses the bug**.\n\n## Why this fix is correct:\n\n**The Problem:** Black was blindly adding a trailing comma to the last element in import statements without considering that the \"last element\" might actually be a comment. This resulted in invalid Python syntax like:\n```python\nfrom .config import (\n    Any,\n    Bool,\n    #  String,\n    ,  # Invalid comma after comment\n)\n```\n\n**The Solution:** The diff replaces the naive approach with a more sophisticated algorithm that:\n\n1. **Iterates backwards** through the leaves to find the last non-comment element\n2. **Skips standalone comments** (`STANDALONE_COMMENT`) when looking for where to place the comma\n3. **Checks if a comma already exists** - if so, it breaks without adding another\n4. **Adds the comma in the correct position** - after the last actual import item, not after comments\n\n**Key improvements:**\n- The loop `for i in range(len(leaves) - 1, -1, -1)` goes backwards through the elements\n- `if leaves[i].type == STANDALONE_COMMENT: continue` skips over comments\n- `elif leaves[i].type == token.COMMA: break` stops if a comma is already present\n- `leaves.insert(i + 1, Leaf(token.COMMA, \",\"))` inserts the comma after the last non-comment element\n\nThis ensures that for the problematic input:\n```python\nfrom .config import (\n    Any,\n    Bool,\n    Path,\n    #  String,\n    #  resolve_to_config_type,\n)\n```\n\nThe comma gets added after `Path` (the last actual import), not after the comments, producing valid Python syntax."}
