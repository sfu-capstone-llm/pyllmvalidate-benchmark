{"is_correct": true, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can confirm that **this diff correctly fixes the bug**.\n\nHere's why this is the right solution:\n\n## Problem Analysis\nThe issues describe failures in AWS Lambda and other virtualized environments where:\n1. `/dev/shm` is not accessible or the filesystem is read-only\n2. This prevents `ProcessPoolExecutor` from initializing due to multiprocessing limitations\n3. Black crashes with `OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system` when trying to create multiprocessing primitives\n\n## Solution Correctness\n\n**1. Proper Exception Handling**\n- The diff wraps `ProcessPoolExecutor` creation in a try-catch block that catches `OSError`\n- This directly addresses the root cause where multiprocessing initialization fails due to system limitations\n\n**2. Graceful Fallback**\n- When `ProcessPoolExecutor` fails, it sets `executor = None`\n- This allows Black to fall back to single-threaded execution instead of crashing\n- The comment clearly explains this is for systems that don't support multi-processing like AWS Lambda\n\n**3. Consistent Null Handling**\n- Adds a null check before calling `executor.shutdown()` to prevent crashes during cleanup\n- Updates the type annotation for the `executor` parameter to `Optional[Executor]` to reflect it can be None\n\n**4. Maintains Existing Functionality**\n- When multiprocessing works normally, behavior is unchanged\n- Only affects systems where multiprocessing would fail anyway\n- Preserves the performance benefit of parallel processing where available\n\n**5. Addresses Both Issues**\n- Fixes #1138 by automatically disabling parallel execution when not supported\n- Fixes #776 by handling the specific `OSError` that causes the crash\n\nThis is a minimal, targeted fix that solves the core problem without breaking existing functionality or requiring configuration changes from users."}
