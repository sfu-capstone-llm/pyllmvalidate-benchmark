{"is_correct": true, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, **this fix correctly addresses the bug**.\n\n**Reason:**\n\nThe bug occurs because on Windows, temporary files default to using the system's default encoding (cp1252 in this case), which cannot handle Unicode characters like '\\u0142' (\u0142) that are present in the test files. The error shows:\n\n```\nUnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\\u0142' in position 4011: character maps to <undefined>\n```\n\nThe fix adds `encoding=\"utf8\"` to the `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()` call, which ensures that:\n\n1. **Cross-platform consistency**: UTF-8 encoding works uniformly across Windows, macOS, and Linux\n2. **Unicode support**: UTF-8 can handle all Unicode characters, including the problematic '\\u0142' character\n3. **Minimal change**: Only adds the necessary parameter without changing any other functionality\n\nThis directly resolves the Windows-specific encoding issue that was causing the tests to fail when writing Unicode characters to temporary files, making the code work consistently across all platforms."}
