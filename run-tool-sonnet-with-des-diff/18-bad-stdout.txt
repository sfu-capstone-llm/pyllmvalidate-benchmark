{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff **correctly** fixes the bug described in the issue.\n\n**Reason:** The diff addresses the core problem by preserving the original file's line endings when formatting in place. Here's why it's correct:\n\n1. **Root cause identification**: The issue was that Black was always using the system's default line endings (CRLF on Windows) regardless of the source file's original line endings.\n\n2. **Proper detection**: The new `prepare_input()` function correctly detects the original line ending style by examining the first line of the file (`b\"\\r\\n\" == lines[0][-2:]`) and preserves this information.\n\n3. **Consistent preservation**: When writing back to files (`write_back == WriteBack.YES`), the diff uses the detected `newline` parameter in the `open()` call, ensuring the original line ending style is maintained.\n\n4. **Comprehensive coverage**: The fix handles all output scenarios:\n   - File in-place formatting (main use case)\n   - Diff output to stdout\n   - Stdin to stdout formatting\n\n5. **Clean implementation**: The solution uses Python's built-in `newline` parameter in file operations, which is the standard way to control line ending behavior.\n\n6. **Backward compatibility**: The change only affects the specific case mentioned in the issue (preserving existing line endings) without breaking other functionality.\n\nThe fix directly solves the problem described in issue #258 where users wanted to maintain Unix line endings on Windows systems, making Black respect the source file's original line ending convention rather than imposing the system default."}
