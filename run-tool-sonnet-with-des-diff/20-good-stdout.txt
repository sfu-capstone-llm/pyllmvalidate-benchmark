{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff **correctly** fixes the bug.\n\n**Reason:** The issue was that Black was only showing the filename (`src.name`) instead of the full path (`src`) in diff output. The code was using `src.name` which extracts just the filename from a Path object, but the fix changes it to use `src` directly, which will display the full path.\n\nLooking at the original problematic lines:\n```python\nsrc_name = f\"{src.name}  (original)\"\ndst_name = f\"{src.name}  (formatted)\"\n```\n\nThe fix changes them to:\n```python\nsrc_name = f\"{src}  (original)\"\ndst_name = f\"{src}  (formatted)\"\n```\n\nThis change ensures that when `black --diff path/to/foo.py` is run, the diff output will show:\n```\n--- path/to/foo.py  (original)\n+++ path/to/foo.py  (formatted)\n```\n\nInstead of just:\n```\n--- foo.py  (original)\n+++ foo.py  (formatted)\n```\n\nThis addresses the user's concern about being able to distinguish between files with the same name in different directories when viewing concatenated diffs, and makes Black's behavior consistent with other diff-producing programs that typically show full paths."}
