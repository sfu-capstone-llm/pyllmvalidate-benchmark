{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff **correctly** fixes the bug described in the issue.\n\n**Reason:** The diff properly addresses the core problem by preserving the original file's line endings when formatting in place. Here's why it's correct:\n\n1. **Root Cause Fixed**: The original code used `tokenize.open()` which automatically converts line endings to the system default, losing the original file's line ending style. The fix replaces this with raw binary reading and explicit line ending detection.\n\n2. **Line Ending Preservation**: The new `prepare_input()` function detects whether the source file uses CRLF (`\\r\\n`) or LF (`\\n`) line endings by examining the first line, then preserves this choice when writing back.\n\n3. **Proper Implementation**: When writing back to files (`write_back.YES`), it uses the detected `newline` parameter in `open()`, which tells Python to use the specific line ending style rather than the system default.\n\n4. **Consistent Behavior**: The fix extends to all output scenarios (file writing, diff output, stdout) to maintain consistency in line ending handling.\n\n5. **Backward Compatibility**: The change only affects the line ending behavior while preserving all other formatting functionality.\n\nThe fix directly solves the reported issue where \"Black outputs CRLF line endings on Windows even if the source file has Unix-style lines\" by ensuring Black now preserves whatever line ending style was originally in the file."}
