{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **incorrect** and does not properly fix the bug.\n\n**Reason:** The fix has a critical flaw in its control flow logic. In the `generate_ignored_nodes` function, when the condition `contains_fmt_on_at_column(container, leaf.column)` is true, the code processes children individually but then **fails to advance the container pointer**. \n\nSpecifically, after the `for child in container.children:` loop completes, there is no `container = container.next_sibling` assignment, which means the function will get stuck in an infinite loop on the same container. The `container = container.next_sibling` line only executes in the `else` branch.\n\nThis creates an infinite loop scenario where:\n1. The function finds a container with `fmt: on` at the target column\n2. It processes all children in that container\n3. It never moves to the next sibling container\n4. The `while container is not None` loop continues indefinitely on the same container\n\nThe fix attempts to address the issue described in #560 where `# fmt: on` doesn't work when crossing block boundaries, but the implementation is fundamentally broken due to this missing control flow logic."}
