{"is_correct": true, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can confirm that **this fix correctly addresses the bug**.\n\n## Why this fix is correct:\n\n**The Problem:** Black was blindly adding a trailing comma to the end of import statements without considering that there might be comments at the end. This resulted in invalid Python syntax like:\n```python\nfrom .config import (\n    Any,\n    Bool,\n    #  String,\n    #  resolve_to_config_type,\n    ,  # <- Invalid: comma after comment\n)\n```\n\n**The Solution:** The diff replaces the naive approach with a smarter algorithm that:\n\n1. **Searches backwards** through the leaves from the end\n2. **Stops if it finds an existing comma** (no need to add another)\n3. **Skips over comments** (`STANDALONE_COMMENT` tokens)\n4. **Inserts the comma after the last non-comment token**\n\nThis ensures the comma is placed in the correct syntactic position - after the last actual import name, not after trailing comments.\n\n**Key improvements:**\n- The backward iteration (`range(len(leaves) - 1, -1, -1)`) finds the right insertion point\n- Comments are properly skipped with `elif leaves[i].type == STANDALONE_COMMENT: continue`\n- The comma is inserted at `i + 1`, which places it immediately after the last non-comment token\n- The logic handles both cases: when there's already a comma and when one needs to be added\n\nThis fix directly addresses the reported issue where Black produced invalid syntax by placing commas after comments in multi-line import statements."}
