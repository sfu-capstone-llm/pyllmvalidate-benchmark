{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can identify several issues that make this fix incorrect:\n\n**The fix is FALSE because:**\n\n1. **Incorrect logic for `no_commas` condition**: The `no_commas` variable is defined as `original.is_def and not any(l.type == token.COMMA for l in leaves)`, but then it's used to prevent adding trailing commas with `if original.is_import and not no_commas`. This logic is backwards - when `no_commas` is True (meaning we're in a function definition with no commas), we should be adding a trailing comma, not preventing it.\n\n2. **Missing implementation for function definitions**: The diff only modifies the import handling logic but doesn't add the corresponding logic to handle function definitions. The code checks `if original.is_import and not no_commas` but there's no equivalent `if original.is_def` branch to actually add trailing commas to single-argument functions.\n\n3. **Incomplete fix**: While the `maybe_remove_trailing_comma` function is correctly updated to handle `typedargslist` in addition to `arglist`, the main logic for adding trailing commas to single-argument functions is not properly implemented.\n\n4. **Logic flow issue**: The `no_commas` variable is calculated but then used in a way that would actually prevent the desired behavior. When a function has one argument with no comma, `no_commas` would be True, and `not no_commas` would be False, preventing the trailing comma addition.\n\nThe fix attempts to address the issue but fails to properly implement the logic needed to add trailing commas to single-argument functions while preserving the existing behavior for imports and multi-argument functions."}
