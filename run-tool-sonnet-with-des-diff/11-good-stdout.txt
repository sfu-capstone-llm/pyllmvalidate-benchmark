{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can see that **this fix is incorrect** for the following reasons:\n\n## Primary Issue: The fix prevents legitimate line shortening\n\nThe diff adds logic to prevent any line with type comments from being shortened, but this is overly broad and incorrect. According to the issue description, the problem is specifically when Black combines multiline function parameters with individual type comments into a single line, creating malformed annotations like:\n\n```python\ndef f(a, b, c):  # type: int  # type: str  # type: bool  # type: (...) -> None\n```\n\nHowever, this fix would prevent **all** lines containing type comments from being shortened, even when it would be perfectly valid to do so.\n\n## Specific Problems:\n\n1. **Too broad scope**: The fix checks for type comments on any comma-separated line, not specifically function parameter lists with individual parameter type annotations.\n\n2. **Doesn't address the core issue**: The real problem is that when Black moves parameters to one line, it concatenates all the individual `# type:` comments, creating invalid syntax. The fix should either:\n   - Keep the parameters on separate lines when they have individual type annotations, OR\n   - Transform the individual type comments into a single consolidated type comment format\n\n3. **Missing logic for proper type comment handling**: The issue suggests the correct behavior should be to convert multiple individual type comments into a single consolidated format like `# type: (int, str, bool) -> None`, but this diff doesn't implement that transformation.\n\n4. **Incomplete implementation**: The diff only prevents line shortening but doesn't provide the alternative formatting that would make the type annotations valid.\n\nThe fix addresses the symptom (preventing the malformed output) but doesn't provide the proper solution (correctly formatting the type annotations when parameters are combined onto one line)."}
