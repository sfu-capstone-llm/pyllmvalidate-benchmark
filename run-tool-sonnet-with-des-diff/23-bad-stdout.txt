{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **false** - it does not correctly fix the bug described in the issue.\n\n**Reason:** The diff addresses the wrong problem entirely.\n\nThe issue #49 is specifically about **Black incorrectly adding spaces before parentheses for built-in functions like `exec` and `eval`**. The user reported that Black was changing:\n```python\nreturn exec(\"code\", {}, {})\n```\nto:\n```python\nreturn exec (\"code\", {}, {})  # unwanted space added\n```\n\nHowever, this diff focuses on **parsing different Python grammar variants** (with/without print/exec statements) rather than fixing the **formatting/spacing issue**. \n\nThe diff:\n1. Adds multiple grammar parsing attempts to handle Python 2 vs Python 3 syntax differences\n2. Adds logic to detect Python 2 print chevron syntax (`print >>`)\n3. Creates new grammar variants without exec statements\n\nBut it completely **ignores the core formatting problem**: preventing Black from inserting unwanted spaces before parentheses when `exec` and `eval` are used as function calls.\n\nThe actual fix should modify the whitespace formatting logic to recognize that `exec` and `eval`, when used as function calls (not statements), should not have spaces inserted before their opening parentheses - similar to how other function calls are handled."}
