{"is_correct": true, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can confirm that **this fix correctly addresses the bug**.\n\n## Why this fix is correct:\n\n1. **Identifies the root cause**: The bug occurs when Black encounters a comment between decorators and incorrectly treats it as requiring blank lines, rather than recognizing it's part of a decorator sequence.\n\n2. **Implements the right logic**: The added condition checks if:\n   - The current line is a decorator (`is_decorator`)\n   - There was a previous line (`self.previous_line`)\n   - The previous line is a comment (`self.previous_line.is_comment`)\n\n3. **Applies the same treatment**: When these conditions are met, it returns `0, 0` (no blank lines), which is the same behavior as the existing decorator-to-decorator case right above it.\n\n4. **Maintains consistency**: The fix follows the existing pattern in the code - the line right above handles \"Don't insert empty lines between decorators\" and this new code handles \"Don't insert empty lines between decorator comments\" using identical logic.\n\n5. **Solves the specific problem**: This directly prevents the insertion of the unwanted blank lines that were causing the flake8 E304 error in the example:\n   ```python\n   @property\n   # TODO: X\n   @property  # No blank lines will be inserted here anymore\n   def foo():\n       pass\n   ```\n\nThe fix is minimal, targeted, and follows the established patterns in the codebase while directly addressing the issue described in the PR."}
