{"is_correct": true, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can confirm that **this diff correctly fixes the bug**.\n\nHere's why this fix is correct:\n\n## Key Problems Addressed\n\n1. **Standalone Comment Handling**: The original code had a hack in `maybe_adapt_standalone_comment()` that converted standalone comments to regular comments with whitespace prefixes. This prevented proper splitting of bracketed expressions containing standalone comments.\n\n2. **Comment Data Structure**: The old `comments: Dict[LeafID, Leaf]` structure couldn't handle multiple comments after a single leaf, which was limiting.\n\n## Correct Solutions Implemented\n\n1. **Removed the Hack**: The diff removes `maybe_adapt_standalone_comment()` entirely, eliminating the problematic conversion of standalone comments to regular comments with artificial whitespace.\n\n2. **Better Comment Storage**: Changed from `Dict[LeafID, Leaf]` to `List[Tuple[Index, Leaf]]` which allows multiple comments after any given leaf position.\n\n3. **New Split Function**: Added `standalone_comment_split()` as a proper split strategy that treats standalone comments as legitimate split points rather than bolting them on with whitespace.\n\n4. **Enhanced Split Logic**: The `split_line()` function now includes `standalone_comment_split` in the list of split functions for bracketed expressions, and checks for `line.contains_standalone_comments` to force splitting when needed.\n\n5. **Safe Appending**: Added `append_safe()` method with proper validation to prevent invalid standalone comment structures.\n\n## Why This Fixes Issue #22\n\nThe original issue showed that Black was incorrectly handling standalone comments inside bracketed expressions by:\n- Converting them to inline comments with artificial indentation\n- Preventing the expression from wrapping properly\n- Moving comments to incorrect positions\n\nThis fix addresses all these problems by:\n- Treating standalone comments as proper split points\n- Maintaining their standalone nature\n- Allowing bracketed expressions to wrap correctly even with embedded standalone comments\n- Using a proper splitting strategy instead of whitespace hacks\n\nThe diff correctly implements a clean, systematic approach to handling standalone comments within bracketed expressions, which directly resolves the formatting issues described in Issue #22."}
