{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **incorrect** and does not properly fix the handling of empty files.\n\n**Reason why this diff is wrong:**\n\nThe change on line 629 introduces a logical error:\n\n```python\n# Original (correct):\nif src_txt[-1] != \"\\n\":\n    src_txt += \"\\n\"\n\n# Changed to (incorrect):\nif src_txt[-1] == \"\\n\":\n    src_txt += \"\\n\"\n```\n\nThis change reverses the logic completely. The original code correctly adds a newline only when the source text doesn't end with one. The modified code would add a newline when the source text already ends with a newline, which is redundant and incorrect.\n\n**Additional issues:**\n\n1. **Empty file handling**: While the diff adds a check for `lines is None` in the `decode_bytes` function, this doesn't address the core issue with empty files in `lib2to3_parse`.\n\n2. **IndexError not prevented**: For empty files (`src_txt == \"\"`), accessing `src_txt[-1]` will still raise an `IndexError` because you cannot index into an empty string.\n\n**What the correct fix should be:**\n\n```python\nif src_txt and src_txt[-1] != \"\\n\":\n    src_txt += \"\\n\"\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```python\nif not src_txt or src_txt[-1] != \"\\n\":\n    src_txt += \"\\n\"\n```\n\nThe fix should ensure that empty strings are handled safely and that newlines are only added when needed, not when they already exist."}
