{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **false** (incorrect).\n\n**Reason:** The diff changes the tab handling logic in a way that contradicts the stated requirement. \n\nAccording to the PR description, \"Indent widths in lib2to3 for tabs are actually counted as 1, not 4, so consuming the prefix needs to match that.\" However, this diff removes the special handling for tabs entirely by:\n\n1. Combining the space and tab handling into a single condition `elif char in ' \\t':`\n2. Removing the separate `elif char == '\\t':` block that added 4 to the column count\n3. Making both spaces and tabs increment the column by only 1\n\nWhile the PR correctly identifies that tabs should be counted as 1 (not 4) for prefix consumption, this implementation is wrong because:\n\n- **Spaces should still increment by 1** (which they do)\n- **Tabs should increment by 1** (which the fix attempts to do)\n- But the current diff makes **both** spaces and tabs increment by 1 in the same code path\n\nThe correct fix should be:\n```python\nelif char == ' ':\n    current_column += 1\nelif char == '\\t':\n    current_column += 1  # Changed from += 4 to += 1\n```\n\nInstead of combining them into `elif char in ' \\t':` which, while functionally equivalent for the increment operation, removes the explicit distinction between space and tab handling that may be important for code clarity and future maintenance."}
