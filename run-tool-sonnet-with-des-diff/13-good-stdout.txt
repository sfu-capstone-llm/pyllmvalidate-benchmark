{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **incorrect** and does not properly fix the bug.\n\n**Reason:** The diff attempts to handle async generators by modifying the tokenizer to recognize `async for` patterns, but it has a critical flaw in its logic. \n\nWhen `token == 'for'` and there's a stashed `async` token, the code yields an `ASYNC` token but **does not set the `async_def` and `async_def_indent` variables** (they're only set when `token == 'def'`). However, the code then continues to the next iteration without yielding the actual `for` token or properly handling the async generator syntax.\n\nThis creates several problems:\n1. The `for` token is never yielded, breaking the token stream\n2. The async generator syntax `(i * 2 async for i in arange(n))` won't be properly tokenized\n3. The fix doesn't actually address the parsing issue described in issue #125\n\nThe correct approach would need to properly handle the tokenization of async generators as a distinct syntactic construct, not just detect the `async for` pattern and yield an `ASYNC` token. The current implementation will likely cause parsing errors or incorrect token streams when encountering async generator expressions."}
