{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **false** - it does not correctly fix the bug.\n\n**Reason:** The diff removes the critical `normalize_prefix()` calls that are essential for proper formatting of bracketed expressions. \n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. **Missing normalization in `delimiter_split()`**: The diff removes the `normalize_prefix(current_line.leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)` calls at lines 1689 and 1699. These calls are crucial for ensuring proper indentation and spacing when splitting lines within brackets.\n\n2. **No normalization in `standalone_comment_split()`**: The new `standalone_comment_split()` function completely lacks any `normalize_prefix()` calls, which means standalone comments won't be properly formatted with correct indentation.\n\n3. **Incomplete implementation**: While the diff adds `standalone_comment_split` to the list of split functions for bracketed expressions, the function itself doesn't properly handle the formatting requirements that would fix the original issue where standalone comments inside nested bracketed expressions prevent proper wrapping.\n\nThe original issue shows that Black was incorrectly moving a comment outside the function call parentheses instead of keeping it properly positioned within the bracketed expression. Without proper prefix normalization, this fix would likely create formatting inconsistencies and fail to address the core problem of comment positioning within nested brackets."}
