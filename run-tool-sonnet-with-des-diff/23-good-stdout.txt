{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **false** - it does not correctly fix the bug.\n\n**Reason:** The diff addresses the wrong problem entirely. \n\nThe issue #49 describes a problem where Black incorrectly adds a space before parentheses for built-in functions like `exec` and `eval`, changing `exec(\"code\", {}, {})` to `exec (\"code\", {}, {})`. This is a **formatting issue** where Black should NOT add spaces before the parentheses of function calls.\n\nHowever, this diff implements functionality to handle **Python 2 syntax parsing** (print and exec statements vs functions), which is completely unrelated to the spacing issue. The changes include:\n\n1. Adding multiple grammar parsers to handle different Python 2/3 syntax combinations\n2. Adding logic to detect Python 2 print chevron syntax (`>>`)\n3. Modifying error messages for `--safe` mode\n\nNone of these changes address the core issue: **preventing Black from adding unwanted spaces before parentheses in function calls like `exec()` and `eval()`**.\n\nThe actual fix should modify the whitespace formatting logic to recognize that `exec`, `eval`, and similar built-ins should be treated as regular function calls without adding spaces before their opening parentheses, not implement Python 2 syntax compatibility."}
