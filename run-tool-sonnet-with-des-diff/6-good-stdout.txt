{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff **correctly** fixes the bug described in the GitHub issue.\n\n**Reason why this fix is correct:**\n\nThe core issue was that Black couldn't parse Python 3.7+ async generator syntax like `(i * 2 for i in range(n) if await wrap(i))` because the tokenizer couldn't determine when `async`/`await` should be treated as keywords vs identifiers in all contexts without breaking compatibility with older Python versions.\n\nThe fix introduces a **tokenizer configuration approach** that solves this elegantly:\n\n1. **New TokenizerConfig class**: Adds an `async_is_reserved_keyword` flag to control tokenizer behavior\n2. **Version-specific feature flags**: Introduces `ASYNC_IS_VALID_IDENTIFIER` and `ASYNC_IS_RESERVED_KEYWORD` features that are mutually exclusive\n3. **Parser configuration per Python version**: \n   - Python 3.7+ uses `async_is_reserved_keyword=True` \n   - Python 3.6 and below use `async_is_reserved_keyword=False`\n4. **Updated tokenizer logic**: Changes the condition from `if async_def:` to `if async_is_reserved_keyword or async_def:` to always treat async/await as keywords when the flag is set\n\nThis approach allows Black to:\n- Parse the problematic Python 3.7 syntax correctly by always tokenizing `await` as a keyword in generator expressions\n- Maintain backward compatibility by using different tokenizer configurations for different Python versions\n- Try multiple parser configurations when target versions are mixed\n\nThe test case in `tests/data/python37.py` confirms the fix works by including the exact problematic code from the issue: `return (i * 2 for i in range(n) if await wrap(i))`."}
