{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can see that **this fix is incorrect** for addressing the bug described in issue #282.\n\n**The main problem is that this diff prevents line splitting when type comments are present, but it doesn't actually fix the malformed type annotation issue.**\n\nHere's why this approach is wrong:\n\n1. **It only prevents splitting, doesn't fix the core problem**: The bug occurs when Black combines multiple lines with type comments into a single line, creating malformed annotations like `# type: int  # type: str  # type: bool  # type: (...) -> None`. This diff just prevents the line from being split when it detects type comments, but it doesn't address what happens when Black is formatting the comments themselves.\n\n2. **Wrong logic flow**: The issue happens during the comment formatting/combination phase, not during the line splitting phase. The `split_line` function is about breaking long lines into multiple lines, but the bug is about how comments are handled when multiple lines are being combined into one.\n\n3. **Doesn't implement the required behavior**: According to the issue description, the correct behavior should be to either:\n   - Leave the function parameters on separate lines (do nothing), OR\n   - Restructure the type annotation to a proper format like `# type: (int, str, bool) -> None`\n   \n   This diff only attempts the first option (preventing splitting) but doesn't handle the case where lines are being combined.\n\n4. **Missing the actual problem location**: The real issue is likely in the code that handles comment formatting and combination when multiple lines with type comments are merged into a single line. This diff doesn't touch that logic at all.\n\nThe fix should instead focus on:\n- Detecting when multiple type comments are being combined\n- Either preventing that combination or properly reformatting the combined type annotation into valid syntax\n- Handling the comment merging logic, not just the line splitting logic"}
