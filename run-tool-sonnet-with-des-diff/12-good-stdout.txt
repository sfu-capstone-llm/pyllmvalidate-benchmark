{"is_correct": true, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can see that it **correctly fixes the bug**.\n\nThe reason is that the original implementation had a fundamental flaw in how it tracked nested lambda expressions and for loops. Here's why the fix is correct:\n\n## The Problem\nThe original code used simple integer counters (`_for_loop_variable` and `_lambda_arguments`) to track when to decrement depth. This approach failed with nested structures because:\n\n1. When encountering nested lambdas, the counter would increment multiple times\n2. When finding a colon `:`, it would decrement for the first lambda encountered, regardless of which lambda the colon actually belonged to\n3. This caused incorrect bracket matching and depth tracking\n\n## The Solution\nThe fix replaces the integer counters with lists that store the specific depth levels:\n\n1. **`_lambda_argument_depths: List[int]`** - Stores the depth at which each lambda was encountered\n2. **`_for_loop_depths: List[int]`** - Stores the depth at which each for loop was encountered\n\n## Why This Fixes the Bug\nIn the failing example:\n```python\npem_spam = lambda l, spam = {\n    \"-----BEGIN PKCS7-----\": True, \"-----END PKCS7-----\": True, \"\": True\n}: not spam.get(l.strip())\n```\n\nThe original code would:\n1. Encounter `lambda` \u2192 increment depth and counter\n2. Encounter `{` \u2192 increment depth further  \n3. Encounter `:` inside the dictionary \u2192 incorrectly decrement for the lambda (wrong colon!)\n4. Later encounter the actual lambda's `:` \u2192 no decrement because counter was already decremented\n\nThe fixed code:\n1. Encounter `lambda` at depth X \u2192 store X in the list\n2. Encounter `:` at depth Y \u2192 only decrement if Y matches the most recent lambda depth\n3. This ensures colons inside nested structures (like dictionaries) don't interfere with lambda bracket tracking\n\nThe fix correctly handles nested structures by tracking the specific depth context rather than just counting occurrences."}
