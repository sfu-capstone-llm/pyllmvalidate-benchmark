{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **incorrect** and does not properly fix the bug.\n\n**Reason:** The diff removes the tab handling logic entirely instead of fixing it. \n\nLooking at the bug description, the issue is that \"Indent widths in lib2to3 for tabs are actually counted as 1, not 4, so consuming the prefix needs to match that.\" The current code incorrectly adds 4 to `current_column` when encountering a tab character, but the fix should change it to add 1, not remove tab handling completely.\n\nThe correct fix should be:\n```python\nelif char == '\\t':\n    current_column += 1  # Changed from += 4 to += 1\n```\n\nBy completely removing the `elif char == '\\t':` block, tabs will not be handled at all in the column calculation, which could lead to other issues with indentation tracking. The bug specifically states that tabs should be counted as width 1 in lib2to3, so the fix needs to preserve tab handling but with the correct width calculation."}
