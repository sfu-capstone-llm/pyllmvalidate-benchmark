{"is_correct": true, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can confirm that **this fix correctly addresses the bug**.\n\nHere's why this is the right solution:\n\n## The Problem\nThe issue was that Black's `EmptyLineTracker` was creating unstable formatting when a file started with a backslash continuation (`\\`) followed by whitespace. The formatter would:\n1. First pass: Remove the backslash and empty line, leaving just `pass`\n2. Second pass: Try to remove another empty line that was already gone\nThis created different outputs between passes, violating Black's stability guarantee.\n\n## The Solution Analysis\nThe fix modifies the `maybe_empty_lines` method in `EmptyLineTracker` to handle the special case of the very first line in a file:\n\n```python\nbefore = (\n    # Black should not insert empty lines at the beginning\n    # of the file\n    0\n    if self.previous_line is None\n    else before - self.previous_after\n)\n```\n\n**Why this works:**\n1. **Identifies first line**: `self.previous_line is None` correctly identifies when we're processing the very first line of the file\n2. **Prevents empty lines at start**: Forces `before = 0` for the first line, ensuring no empty lines are inserted at the beginning of the file\n3. **Preserves normal behavior**: For all other lines, uses the original logic `before - self.previous_after`\n4. **Addresses root cause**: The PR description correctly notes \"there should be no situation where Black outputs a file formatted with empty lines at the beginning\"\n\n## Correctness Verification\n- **Fixes the instability**: By ensuring the first line never gets empty lines before it, both passes will produce identical output\n- **Maintains formatting rules**: Empty line rules between classes, functions, etc. remain unchanged\n- **Simple and targeted**: The fix is minimal and only affects the problematic edge case\n- **Aligns with Black's philosophy**: Black shouldn't produce files with leading empty lines\n\nThis is a well-targeted fix that addresses the specific boundary condition in `EmptyLineTracker` that was causing the unstable formatting behavior."}
