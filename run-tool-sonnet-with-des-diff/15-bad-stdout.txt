{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can see that it's attempting to fix the `# fmt: off` issue by replacing the exception-based handling with a separate pass approach. However, **this diff is incorrect** for the following key reasons:\n\n## Primary Issues:\n\n1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The diff removes the exception-based `FormatError`, `FormatOn`, and `FormatOff` classes and the `UnformattedLines` class, but the new `normalize_fmt_off()` function that's supposed to replace this functionality is not properly integrated into the formatting pipeline. The function exists but there's no evidence it's being called during the main formatting process.\n\n2. **Missing Integration Point**: The old system worked by having `generate_comments()` raise exceptions when it encountered `# fmt: off`/`# fmt: on` comments, which were then caught in `visit_default()`. The new system removes these exceptions but doesn't show where `normalize_fmt_off()` gets called in the formatting pipeline.\n\n3. **Logic Gap in `convert_one_fmt_off_pair()`**: The function attempts to convert `# fmt: off`/`# fmt: on` pairs into standalone comments, but the logic for handling the content between these markers is incomplete. It collects \"ignored nodes\" but doesn't properly preserve their original formatting, which was the core requirement from the bug report.\n\n4. **Loss of State Tracking**: The original `UnformattedLines` class maintained state about which lines should remain unformatted. The new approach converts everything to standalone comments, but this doesn't preserve the original formatting of the code between `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` markers.\n\n## Specific Technical Problems:\n\n- The `generate_ignored_nodes()` function stops at `# fmt: on` but doesn't guarantee that the content between the markers will remain unformatted\n- The removal of exception-based flow control without a clear replacement mechanism\n- No evidence that `normalize_fmt_off()` is called at the right point in the formatting process\n\nThe bug report specifically mentioned that formatting was being applied to code between `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` (like the tuple reformatting in `test_calculate_fades`), but this diff doesn't provide a complete solution to prevent that formatting from occurring."}
