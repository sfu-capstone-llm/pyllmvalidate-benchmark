{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **incorrect** and does not properly fix the bug.\n\n**Reason:** The diff changes the `exists=False` parameter to `exists=True` in the `--config` option definition. While this change would indeed cause Click to validate that the config file exists and return exit code 2 when it doesn't, it creates a more serious problem: **it makes it impossible to specify a config file that doesn't exist yet**.\n\nThe `exists=True` parameter tells Click to validate that the file must already exist on the filesystem. This is overly restrictive because:\n\n1. Users might want to specify a config file path that doesn't exist yet (which should be handled gracefully by the application)\n2. The application should be able to handle missing config files internally and provide appropriate error messages\n3. This change would break legitimate use cases where a config file path is specified but the file hasn't been created yet\n\nThe correct fix should handle the missing config file case in the `read_pyproject_toml` callback function or in the main application logic, where it can distinguish between \"file doesn't exist\" (exit code 2) and \"file exists but has formatting issues that need fixing\" (exit code 1), rather than using Click's built-in file existence validation which is too blunt an instrument for this use case."}
