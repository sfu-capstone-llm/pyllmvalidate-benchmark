{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **false** - it does not correctly fix the bug.\n\n**Reason:** The diff fundamentally misunderstands how `# fmt: on` should work and introduces incorrect logic that breaks the expected behavior.\n\n**Key Problems:**\n\n1. **Incorrect `fmt_off()` logic**: The new `fmt_off()` function returns `True` when formatting should be OFF, but the main logic uses `if fmt_off(container): return` which would stop yielding nodes when formatting is OFF. This is backwards - we want to yield (ignore) nodes when formatting is OFF, not when it's ON.\n\n2. **Wrong termination condition**: The original bug is that `# fmt: on` doesn't properly re-enable formatting when it crosses block boundaries. However, this fix tries to detect `fmt: off` at specific columns and process children individually, which doesn't address the core issue of `fmt: on` not being recognized.\n\n3. **Breaks the state machine**: The original code maintains a simple state machine where `fmt: on` and `fmt: off` toggle the formatting state. This diff abandons that approach for a complex column-based detection that doesn't properly handle the sequential nature of format toggles.\n\n4. **Missing `fmt: on` handling**: The diff focuses on detecting `fmt: off` but doesn't properly implement the logic to stop ignoring nodes when `fmt: on` is encountered, which is the actual bug being reported.\n\nThe correct fix should maintain the state machine approach but ensure that `fmt: on` comments are properly detected even when they appear in child nodes of a different indentation level than where `fmt: off` was encountered."}
