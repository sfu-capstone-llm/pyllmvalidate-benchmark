{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **incorrect** and does not properly fix the bug.\n\n**Reason:** The diff changes the wrong branch of the conditional logic. \n\nLooking at the code:\n- The condition `all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)` checks if ALL target versions are NOT Python 2\n- When this is `True`, it means we're targeting Python 3 only, so the comment and grammar selection should be for Python 3\n- When this is `False`, it means we have Python 2 in our target versions, so we should use Python 2-compatible grammars\n\nThe bug occurs when `--target-version py27` is used, which means we have Python 2 in our target versions, so the condition evaluates to `False` and we go to the `else` branch.\n\nThe diff incorrectly:\n1. Changes the comment in the `True` branch (Python 3 only case) from \"Python 2-compatible\" to \"Python 3-compatible\" \n2. Changes the grammar list in the `False` branch (Python 2 case) to include `python_grammar_no_print_statement` first\n\nThe real issue is that when targeting Python 2, the code should use `pygram.python_grammar` (which treats `print` as a statement, not a function) rather than grammars that treat `print` as a function. The fix should ensure that when Python 2 is in the target versions, only `python_grammar` is used, not the \"no print statement\" variants that would cause `print()` to be formatted as a function call with extra whitespace."}
