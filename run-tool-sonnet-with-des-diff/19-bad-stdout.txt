{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **incorrect** and does not properly fix the bug.\n\n**Reason:** The diff adds logic to insert a blank line after decorator comments, but this is the opposite of what's needed. The bug report shows that Black is incorrectly **adding** blank lines between decorators when there's a comment, and flake8 complains about these unwanted blank lines with error \"E304 blank lines found after function decorator\".\n\nThe issue is that when there's a comment between decorators like:\n```python\n@property\n# TODO: X\n@property\ndef foo():\n    pass\n```\n\nBlack should **not** add blank lines, but the current code is adding them. The fix should prevent blank lines from being inserted in this scenario, not add more blank lines as this diff does.\n\nThe correct fix would need to modify the logic to recognize that when there's a comment between decorators, it should still be treated as part of the decorator sequence and maintain the \"Don't insert empty lines between decorators\" behavior that already exists in the code."}
