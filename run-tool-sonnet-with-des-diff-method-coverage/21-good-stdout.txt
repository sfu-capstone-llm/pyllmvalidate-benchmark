{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff **correctly** fixes the bug.\n\n**Reason:** The issue is a Unicode encoding error on Windows where the `dump_to_file` function fails when trying to write Unicode characters (specifically `\\u0142`) to a temporary file. On Windows, the default encoding for text files is `cp1252`, which cannot handle certain Unicode characters.\n\nThe fix adds `encoding=\"utf8\"` to the `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()` call, which ensures that the temporary file is opened with UTF-8 encoding instead of the system default. This allows the function to properly write Unicode characters without raising a `UnicodeEncodeError`.\n\nThe error traceback in the issue shows the exact problem:\n- The error occurs in `dump_to_file` at line `f.write(lines)`\n- It's a `UnicodeEncodeError` from the `cp1252` codec trying to encode `\\u0142`\n- The character \"maps to <undefined>\" in the cp1252 encoding\n\nBy explicitly specifying UTF-8 encoding, the temporary file can handle all Unicode characters, resolving the Windows-specific test failures described in issue #124."}
