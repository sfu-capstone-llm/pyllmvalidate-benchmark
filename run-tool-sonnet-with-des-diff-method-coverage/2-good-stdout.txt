{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The fix is false because it has a critical logic error in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function that breaks the iteration pattern.**\n\nHere's the specific problem:\n\n```python\n# In the original code:\ncontainer = container.next_sibling\n\n# In the modified code:\nif contains_fmt_on_at_column(container, leaf.column):\n    for child in container.children:\n        if contains_fmt_on_at_column(child, leaf.column):\n            return\n        yield child\nelse:\n    yield container\n    container = container.next_sibling  # This line is INSIDE the else block\n```\n\n**The bug:** When `contains_fmt_on_at_column(container, leaf.column)` returns `True`, the code processes the children but **never advances `container` to the next sibling**. This creates an infinite loop because:\n\n1. The `while container is not None` loop continues\n2. But `container` is never updated when the first condition is true\n3. The same container will be processed repeatedly forever\n\n**What should happen:** After processing children in the `if` branch, the code should still advance to the next sibling to continue the iteration.\n\nThe correct fix would need to ensure `container = container.next_sibling` happens in both branches, or restructure the logic to avoid this infinite loop condition.\n\nThis is a fundamental control flow error that would cause the formatter to hang indefinitely when encountering the specific fmt: on/off pattern described in the issue."}
