{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The diff fails to properly clean up the depth tracking lists, which will cause memory leaks and incorrect bracket matching behavior.**\n\nHere's the specific problem:\n\nIn both `maybe_decrement_after_for_loop_variable` and `maybe_decrement_after_lambda_arguments` methods, the code comments out the crucial cleanup lines:\n\n```python\n# self._for_loop_depths.pop()\n```\nand\n```python\n# self._lambda_argument_depths.pop()\n```\n\n**Why this is wrong:**\n\n1. **Memory leak**: The lists `_for_loop_depths` and `_lambda_argument_depths` will keep growing indefinitely as they never remove processed depths, even after the corresponding for-loops and lambda expressions are fully processed.\n\n2. **Incorrect bracket matching**: Since the depths are never removed from the lists, future bracket matching logic will incorrectly reference stale depth information from previously processed constructs.\n\n3. **Logic error**: The condition `self._lambda_argument_depths[-1] == self.depth` will become unreliable because the list contains outdated depth values that should have been removed.\n\n**The correct fix should:**\n- Keep the new list-based approach (which is good for handling nested constructs)\n- **Uncomment and keep the `.pop()` operations** to properly clean up the tracking lists when exiting lambda arguments and for-loop contexts\n- This ensures each depth is tracked while active and properly removed when the construct is complete\n\nThe current diff introduces a more serious bug than it fixes by creating memory leaks and corrupting the bracket tracking state."}
