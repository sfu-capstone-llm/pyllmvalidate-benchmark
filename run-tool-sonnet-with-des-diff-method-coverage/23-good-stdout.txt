{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **false** because it does not correctly fix the bug described in the issue.\n\nThe main reason is that **the diff addresses the wrong problem**. Let me explain:\n\n## The Issue Description\nIssue #49 states that Black is incorrectly adding a space before parentheses for built-in functions like `exec` and `eval`:\n\n```python\n# Before (correct)\nreturn exec(\"code\", {}, {})\n\n# After Black formatting (incorrect)  \nreturn exec (\"code\", {}, {})\n```\n\nThe issue is about **removing unwanted spaces** that Black adds before parentheses for these functions.\n\n## What the Diff Actually Does\nHowever, this diff primarily focuses on:\n\n1. **Grammar parsing improvements** - Adding multiple grammar variants to handle Python 2 `print` and `exec` statements\n2. **Adding a special case for Python 2 print chevron syntax** (`print >>`) in the whitespace function\n3. **Improving error messages** for `--safe` mode\n\n## The Critical Missing Fix\nThe diff **completely fails to address the core spacing issue**. Looking at the `whitespace()` function in `black.py`, there's no logic added to prevent spaces before parentheses for `exec` and `eval` function calls.\n\nThe only whitespace-related change is for Python 2 print chevron syntax:\n```python\nelif (\n    prevp.type == token.RIGHTSHIFT\n    and prevp.parent\n    and prevp.parent.type == syms.shift_expr\n    and prevp.prev_sibling\n    and prevp.prev_sibling.type == token.NAME\n    and prevp.prev_sibling.value == 'print'\n):\n    # Python 2 print chevron\n    return NO\n```\n\nThis handles `print >>` syntax but does nothing for the reported issue of `exec(\"code\")` becoming `exec (\"code\")`.\n\n## What's Missing\nThe fix should include logic in the `whitespace()` function to detect when a function call involves `exec` or `eval` and prevent adding spaces before the opening parenthesis, similar to how other built-in functions are handled.\n\nThe diff addresses grammar parsing for Python 2 compatibility but ignores the actual formatting bug that was reported."}
