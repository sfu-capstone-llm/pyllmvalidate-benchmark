{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can identify why it's **incorrect** in fixing the bug:\n\n## The Problem with the Fix\n\nThe diff attempts to fix the trailing comma issue for functions with one argument, but it has a **fundamental logical flaw** in the `bracket_split_build_line` function.\n\n### Issue 1: Incorrect `no_commas` Logic\n\n```python\nno_commas = original.is_def and not any(\n    l.type == token.COMMA for l in leaves\n)\n\nif original.is_import and not no_commas:\n```\n\nThe logic here is backwards. The condition `if original.is_import and not no_commas:` means:\n- \"If this is an import AND there ARE commas present, then add trailing comma\"\n\nBut for function definitions, we want the **opposite behavior**:\n- \"If this is a function definition AND there are NO commas present, then add trailing comma\"\n\n### Issue 2: Missing Function Definition Handling\n\nThe code only checks for `original.is_import` but never actually handles the case where `original.is_def` is true. The `no_commas` variable is calculated but never used for function definitions.\n\n### What Should Happen\n\nAccording to the bug description, a function with one argument should **keep** its trailing comma when formatted. The current fix:\n\n1. Correctly identifies when we have a function definition with no commas (`no_commas = True`)\n2. But then only applies trailing comma logic to imports, ignoring function definitions entirely\n3. The `no_commas` condition actually **prevents** trailing commas from being added to imports when there are no existing commas\n\n### Expected Fix\n\nThe code should have logic like:\n```python\nif (original.is_import or (original.is_def and no_commas)):\n    # Add trailing comma logic here\n```\n\nThis would ensure that both imports and single-argument functions get trailing commas, which matches the requirement from the bug description.\n\nThe current diff fails to implement the core requirement: ensuring single-argument functions retain their trailing commas."}
