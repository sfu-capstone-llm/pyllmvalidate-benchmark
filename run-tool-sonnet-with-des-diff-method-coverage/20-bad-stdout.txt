{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **incorrect** because it has a critical bug in the destination filename.\n\nThe issue is on line 345:\n```python\ndst_name = f\"{src}  (original)\"\n```\n\nThis should be:\n```python\ndst_name = f\"{src}  (formatted)\"\n```\n\nThe diff correctly changes `src.name` to `src` to show the full path (which fixes the main issue described in #130), but it mistakenly sets both the source and destination names to \"(original)\" instead of having the destination be \"(formatted)\". This would make the diff output confusing and incorrect, as both files would appear to be labeled as \"original\" when one should be labeled as \"formatted\".\n\nThe correct fix should be:\n```python\nsrc_name = f\"{src}  (original)\"\ndst_name = f\"{src}  (formatted)\"  # Not \"(original)\"\n```\n\nThis bug would make it impossible to distinguish between the original and formatted versions in the diff output, defeating the purpose of showing a diff at all."}
