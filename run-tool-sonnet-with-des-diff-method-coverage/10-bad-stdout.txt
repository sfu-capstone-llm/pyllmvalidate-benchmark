{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **false** because it **removes the tab handling logic entirely** instead of fixing the tab width calculation.\n\nThe bug description clearly states that \"Indent widths in lib2to3 for tabs are actually counted as 1, not 4, so consuming the prefix needs to match that.\" However, the diff removes these lines:\n\n```python\nelif char == '\\t':\n    current_column += 4\n```\n\nThis completely eliminates tab handling from the `_partially_consume_prefix` method. The correct fix should have been to change `current_column += 4` to `current_column += 1` to match lib2to3's tab counting behavior, not to remove tab handling altogether.\n\nBy removing the tab case entirely, tabs will now fall through to the default behavior and won't be handled at all when calculating column positions for prefix consumption. This will likely cause other issues with tab-indented code beyond just the original indentation problem described in issue #262.\n\nThe fix should preserve the tab handling logic but use the correct width calculation of 1 instead of 4."}
