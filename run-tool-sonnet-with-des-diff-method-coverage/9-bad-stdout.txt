{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this git diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The diff is false because it changes the wrong grammar selection logic.**\n\nThe bug description clearly states that Black is incorrectly adding whitespace around `print()` when `--target-version py27` is used. The issue is that when targeting Python 2.7, Black should treat `print` as a function (not a statement) when `from __future__ import print_function` is present.\n\nHowever, the diff makes the following incorrect changes:\n\n1. **Wrong condition logic**: The diff changes the condition from checking if all versions are NOT Python 2 to something else, but the logic is backwards.\n\n2. **Wrong grammar selection**: In the `else` branch (which handles cases where Python 2 is included in target versions), the diff changes from `return [pygram.python_grammar]` to `return [pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement]`.\n\nThis is incorrect because:\n- `pygram.python_grammar` includes the print statement grammar (treating `print` as a statement)\n- `pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement` excludes the print statement grammar (treating `print` as a function only)\n\nWhen targeting Python 2.7 with `from __future__ import print_function`, we want to treat `print` as a function, so we should use the grammar WITHOUT the print statement. However, the original code was using `pygram.python_grammar` (which includes print statement support), and the diff changes it to `pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement`, which seems correct.\n\nBut wait - looking more carefully at the comment change and the overall logic, the real issue is that the condition logic in the `elif` branch is wrong. The comment change from \"Python 2-compatible code, so don't try Python 3 grammar\" to \"Python 3-compatible code, so don't try Python 2 grammar\" suggests the condition should be checking for Python 3, not Python 2.\n\nThe fundamental problem is that this diff doesn't properly handle the case where we have Python 2.7 as a target but want to use function-style print due to `from __future__ import print_function`. The grammar selection logic needs to be more sophisticated to detect this case."}
