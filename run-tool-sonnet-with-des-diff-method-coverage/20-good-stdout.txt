{"is_correct": false, "reason": "The code diff is **incorrect** and does not properly fix the bug.\n\n**Reason:** The diff changes `src.name` to `src` in the diff output formatting, but this change is fundamentally flawed because:\n\n1. **Type mismatch**: `src` is a `pathlib.Path` object, not a string. When converted to string via `f\"{src}\"`, it will show the full path, but this is an implicit conversion that relies on `Path.__str__()`.\n\n2. **Inconsistent with the codebase**: Looking at the method trace and the fact that `tokenize.open` and `pathlib.__str__` are called, we can see that `src` is indeed a `Path` object. The original code correctly used `src.name` to get just the filename portion.\n\n3. **The real issue**: The bug report states that the problem is on lines 298-299 in the original code, but this diff is changing different lines (344-345). This suggests either:\n   - The line numbers have shifted due to other changes, or\n   - This diff is addressing the wrong location entirely\n\n4. **Proper fix should be**: The fix should change `src.name` to `str(src)` or just `src` (relying on implicit string conversion), but it should be done consistently and with proper type handling.\n\nThe current diff will likely work by accident due to Python's string formatting automatically calling `__str__()` on the Path object, but it's not the clean, intentional fix that should be implemented. A proper fix would be more explicit about the string conversion and ensure type safety."}
