{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The diff is false because it removes critical normalization logic that is essential for proper formatting.**\n\nThe key issue is in the `delimiter_split` function where this line was removed:\n\n```python\nnormalize_prefix(current_line.leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)\n```\n\nThis line was called twice in the original code:\n1. Before yielding a line when splitting at a delimiter\n2. At the end before yielding the final line\n\nThe diff removes both calls to `normalize_prefix`, which is a critical problem because:\n\n1. **`normalize_prefix` is responsible for proper indentation and whitespace handling** - without it, the formatted code will have incorrect indentation and spacing\n2. **The `inside_brackets=True` parameter is specifically important** for handling whitespace within bracketed expressions, which is exactly what this PR is supposed to fix\n3. **The bug description shows that the issue is about standalone comments within bracketed expressions** - removing the normalization logic would make the formatting worse, not better\n\nAdditionally, the diff introduces a new `standalone_comment_split` function but also removes the conditional logic that prevented right-hand splitting when there were multiline strings or comments. The original code had:\n\n```python\nif '\\n' not in line_str:\n    # Only attempt RHS if we don't have multiline strings or comments\n    # on this line.\n    split_funcs.append(right_hand_split)\n```\n\nThis was replaced with unconditionally adding `right_hand_split` to the split functions, which could cause issues with multiline content.\n\nThe diff appears to be attempting to fix standalone comment handling but does so by removing essential formatting logic rather than properly integrating comment handling with the existing normalization system."}
