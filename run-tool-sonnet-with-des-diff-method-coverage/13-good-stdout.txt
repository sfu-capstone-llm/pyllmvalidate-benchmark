{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The diff is false because it breaks the async function detection logic.**\n\nHere's the critical issue:\n\nThe original code correctly handles `async def` by setting both `async_def = True` and `async_def_indent = indents[-1]` when it encounters the pattern `async def`. However, the modified code only sets these variables when `token == 'def'`, but it also triggers the ASYNC token emission for `async for`.\n\n**The problem:**\n1. When the tokenizer encounters `async for`, it will emit an ASYNC token (which is correct for async generators)\n2. But it won't set `async_def = True` and `async_def_indent = indents[-1]` because `token == 'for'`, not `'def'`\n3. This means the async function tracking state remains unchanged, which could lead to incorrect tokenization behavior later\n\n**What should happen:**\nThe code should emit the ASYNC token for both `async def` and `async for` patterns, but only update the async function state variables (`async_def` and `async_def_indent`) for `async def`, not for `async for`.\n\n**The correct fix would be:**\n```python\nif token in ('def', 'for'):\n    if (stashed\n            and stashed[0] == NAME\n            and stashed[1] == 'async'):\n\n        if token == 'def':\n            async_def = True\n            async_def_indent = indents[-1]\n\n        yield (ASYNC, stashed[1],\n               stashed[2], stashed[3],\n               stashed[4])\n        # ... rest of the logic\n```\n\nThe current diff correctly identifies that both `def` and `for` should trigger ASYNC token emission when preceded by `async`, but it fails to properly maintain the async function state tracking that's crucial for the tokenizer's operation."}
