{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The diff removes the entire `# fmt: off`/`# fmt: on` handling mechanism without properly implementing the replacement functionality.**\n\nHere are the key issues:\n\n1. **Removed Exception-Based Handling Without Proper Replacement**: The diff removes the `FormatError`, `FormatOn`, and `FormatOff` exception classes and the try-catch logic in `visit_default()` that handled these exceptions. However, the new `normalize_fmt_off()` function that's supposed to replace this functionality is fundamentally flawed.\n\n2. **Critical Logic Error in `convert_one_fmt_off_pair()`**: The function attempts to convert `# fmt: off`/`# fmt: on` pairs into standalone comments, but it has a major flaw:\n   ```python\n   for comment in list_comments(leaf.prefix, is_endmarker=False):\n       if comment.value in FMT_OFF:\n           # ... process fmt: off\n           return True  # This returns immediately after finding the first fmt: off\n   ```\n   This means it only processes the **first** `# fmt: off` comment it encounters and then stops, ignoring any subsequent ones in the file.\n\n3. **Incomplete Implementation**: The new approach tries to convert fmt: off/on regions into standalone comments during a preprocessing step, but this approach is fundamentally different from the original exception-based approach and doesn't properly handle the formatting suppression across statement boundaries.\n\n4. **Missing Integration**: The `normalize_fmt_off()` function is called early in `format_str()`, but the line generation and formatting logic no longer has any awareness of fmt: off regions since all the exception handling was removed.\n\nThe original issue #335 was that \"fmt: off is ignored after first function\" - this diff doesn't fix that problem and actually makes it worse by only processing the first fmt: off comment in the entire file, rather than properly handling multiple fmt: off/on pairs throughout the code.\n\nThe diff represents an incomplete refactoring that removes working (albeit hacky) functionality without properly implementing the replacement, making the fmt: off feature essentially non-functional."}
