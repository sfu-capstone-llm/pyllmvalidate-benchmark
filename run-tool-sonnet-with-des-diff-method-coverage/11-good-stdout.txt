{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can identify why it is **false** - it does not correctly fix the bug described in the issue.\n\n## Why this diff is incorrect:\n\n**1. Incomplete Detection Logic**\nThe diff only checks for type comments after comma tokens (`leaf.type == token.COMMA`), but type comments can appear after other tokens in function signatures, including the closing parenthesis. The original issue shows:\n```python\ndef f(a,  # type: int\n      b,  # type: str  \n      c,  # type: bool\n      ):  # type: (...) -> None\n```\nThe return type comment `# type: (...) -> None` appears after the closing parenthesis, not after a comma.\n\n**2. Wrong Prevention Strategy**\nThe diff prevents line splitting entirely when special comments are detected (`has_special_comment = True`), but this doesn't solve the core problem. The issue isn't that the line shouldn't be split - it's that when multiple type comments are combined onto one line, they become malformed syntax like:\n```python\ndef f(a, b, c):  # type: int  # type: str  # type: bool  # type: (...) -> None\n```\n\n**3. Missing Comment Transformation Logic**\nThe requirements clearly state that when type comments are consolidated, they should be transformed into proper syntax like:\n```python\ndef f(a, b, c):  # type: (int, str, bool) -> None\n```\nThe diff contains no logic to perform this transformation.\n\n**4. No Handling of Line Length Considerations**\nThe requirements mention that if the consolidated type annotation is too long, it should be moved to a separate line. The diff doesn't implement this behavior.\n\n**5. Doesn't Address the Core Issue**\nThe fundamental problem is that Black concatenates multiple `# type:` comments without understanding their semantic meaning. Simply preventing line splitting doesn't fix the malformed output - it just avoids the situation entirely, which may not be the desired behavior when the line could fit within length limits with proper comment consolidation.\n\nThe diff is a partial workaround that prevents the immediate syntax error but doesn't implement the proper solution described in the issue requirements."}
