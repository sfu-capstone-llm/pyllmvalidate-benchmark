{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **false** because it incorrectly handles the case described in the issue.\n\nThe bug report shows that Black is incorrectly adding blank lines between a decorator and a comment that appears between decorators. The issue is with this specific pattern:\n\n```python\n@property\n# TODO: X\n@property\ndef foo():\n    pass\n```\n\nThe problem is that the fix only checks if the current line is a decorator (`is_decorator`) and the previous line is a comment (`self.previous_line.is_comment`). However, this logic is flawed because:\n\n1. **It's checking the wrong direction**: The issue occurs when we have a comment followed by a decorator, but the fix is checking for a decorator followed by a comment.\n\n2. **It doesn't address the root cause**: The original code already has logic to prevent empty lines between decorators (`if is_decorator and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator`). The issue is that when there's a comment between decorators, the comment breaks this chain of decorator detection.\n\n3. **The fix is too broad**: This change would prevent blank lines in cases where they might be legitimately needed, such as when a comment appears after a decorator but before a non-decorator line.\n\nThe correct fix should handle the case where we're processing a decorator that comes after a comment, and that comment itself came after another decorator. The current fix doesn't establish this chain of decorator-comment-decorator relationships that the issue describes."}
