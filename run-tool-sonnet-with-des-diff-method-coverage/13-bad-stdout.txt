{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The diff is false because it breaks the logic for detecting async function definitions.**\n\nHere's the problem:\n\n1. **Original logic**: The code was specifically designed to detect `async def` patterns by checking if the current token is `'def'` and there's a stashed `'async'` token before it.\n\n2. **The broken change**: The diff changes the condition from `if token == 'def':` to `if token == 'def' or token == 'for':`, which means it will now treat both `async def` and `async for` the same way.\n\n3. **Why this is wrong**: When the code encounters `async for`, it incorrectly sets `async_def = True` and `async_def_indent = indents[-1]`, which are variables specifically meant to track async function definitions, not async for loops.\n\n4. **The actual requirement**: Based on the PR description, the goal is to support parsing async generators like `(i * 2 async for i in arange(n))`. However, this change conflates async function definitions with async for comprehensions, which are completely different constructs.\n\nThe fix should properly handle async for loops as a separate case rather than treating them the same as async function definitions. The current approach will likely cause incorrect tokenization behavior because it's using function-specific tracking variables (`async_def`, `async_def_indent`) for loop constructs.\n\nA proper fix would need to either:\n- Add separate handling for async for loops, or  \n- Modify the tokenization logic to properly distinguish between async function definitions and async comprehensions\n\nThis diff demonstrates a common anti-pattern of making minimal changes that appear to work but actually break the underlying logic by mixing unrelated concepts."}
