{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug. Here's why:\n\nThe core issue was that Black couldn't parse Python 3.7+ async generator syntax like `(i * 2 for i in range(n) if await wrap(i))` because the tokenizer couldn't determine when `async`/`await` should be treated as keywords versus identifiers in all contexts, particularly inside generators.\n\n**The fix introduces a tokenizer configuration approach that correctly addresses this:**\n\n1. **New TokenizerConfig class**: Adds a `async_is_reserved_keyword` boolean flag to control how the tokenizer treats `async`/`await` tokens.\n\n2. **Version-specific feature flags**: Introduces `ASYNC_IS_VALID_IDENTIFIER` and `ASYNC_IS_RESERVED_KEYWORD` features that are mutually exclusive and properly assigned to Python versions:\n   - Python 2.7-3.6: `ASYNC_IS_VALID_IDENTIFIER` (async/await can be identifiers)\n   - Python 3.7+: `ASYNC_IS_RESERVED_KEYWORD` (async/await are always keywords)\n\n3. **Parser configuration logic**: The `get_parser_configs()` function now returns different parser configurations based on target Python versions, ensuring the tokenizer uses the correct mode.\n\n4. **Tokenizer modification**: In `generate_tokens()`, the logic now checks `async_is_reserved_keyword` flag in addition to the existing `async_def` context, allowing `async`/`await` to be tokenized as keywords in Python 3.7+ even outside of async function definitions.\n\n5. **Test coverage**: The test file includes the exact problematic syntax from the issue: `return (i * 2 for i in range(n) if await wrap(i))`.\n\nThe fix is elegant because it:\n- Maintains backward compatibility for older Python versions\n- Correctly handles the new Python 3.7+ grammar rules\n- Uses a configuration-driven approach rather than trying to infer context\n- Follows the principle that when targeting Python 3.7+, `async`/`await` should always be treated as reserved keywords\n\nThe method trace and coverage data confirm the new code paths are being executed, and the test passes, demonstrating the fix works correctly."}
