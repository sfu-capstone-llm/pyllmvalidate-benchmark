{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this git diff, I can immediately identify why it's **false** - it does not correctly fix the bug described in the issue.\n\n## Why this diff is false:\n\n**The bug is about preventing spaces before parentheses in built-in functions like `exec` and `print`, but this diff actually makes the problem worse by adding MORE parsing complexity without addressing the core formatting issue.**\n\n### The actual problem from Issue #49:\nThe issue shows that Black incorrectly reformats:\n```python\nreturn exec(\"code\", {}, {})  # Good - no space before parentheses\n```\nto:\n```python\nreturn exec (\"code\", {}, {})  # Bad - unwanted space before parentheses\n```\n\n### What the diff does wrong:\n\n1. **Adds unnecessary parsing complexity**: The diff creates multiple grammar variants and tries to parse with each one, which is overkill for a simple formatting issue.\n\n2. **Incomplete whitespace logic**: While it adds some logic for Python 2 print chevron (`print >>`) in the `whitespace()` function, it doesn't properly handle the core issue of preventing spaces before parentheses for `exec` and `print` function calls.\n\n3. **Missing the main fix**: The diff doesn't add the crucial logic to prevent spaces before opening parentheses when the preceding token is `exec` or `print` used as function calls (not statements).\n\n### What the correct fix should do:\n\nThe fix should add logic in the `whitespace()` function to return `NO` (no space) when:\n- The current leaf is an opening parenthesis `(`\n- The previous leaf is `exec` or `print` \n- These are being used as function calls (not Python 2 statements)\n\nThe diff attempts to address Python 2 compatibility but misses the fundamental formatting rule that's causing the unwanted space insertion."}
