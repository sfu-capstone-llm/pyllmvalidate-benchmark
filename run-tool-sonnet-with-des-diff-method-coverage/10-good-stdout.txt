{"is_correct": true, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately see that **this fix is correct**.\n\nThe reason is straightforward: **The diff fixes the inconsistent handling of tab characters in indent calculation**.\n\nHere's why this fix is correct:\n\n1. **Root Cause**: The bug was in the `_partially_consume_prefix` method where tabs were being counted as 4 columns (`current_column += 4`) while spaces were counted as 1 column (`current_column += 1`).\n\n2. **The Problem**: According to the PR description, \"Indent widths in lib2to3 for tabs are actually counted as 1, not 4\". The original code was incorrectly treating tabs as having a width of 4, which caused misalignment when calculating prefixes for comments after dedents.\n\n3. **The Fix**: The diff changes the logic to treat both spaces and tabs uniformly as single-column characters:\n   - **Before**: `elif char == ' ': current_column += 1` and `elif char == '\\t': current_column += 4`\n   - **After**: `elif char in ' \\t': current_column += 1`\n\n4. **Validation from Issue #262**: The issue shows exactly this problem - when a file uses tabs, comments after dedents get incorrectly indented. The sample shows a comment that should align with the `pass` statement but gets over-indented instead.\n\n5. **Consistency with lib2to3**: The fix aligns the tab handling in Black's driver with lib2to3's actual behavior, where tabs are counted as width 1, not 4.\n\nThis is a precise fix that addresses the specific inconsistency between how Black was calculating column positions for tabs versus how lib2to3 actually handles them, resolving the indentation bug for tabulated comments after dedents."}
