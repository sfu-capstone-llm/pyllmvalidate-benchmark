{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can identify several critical issues that make this fix incorrect:\n\n## The fix is false because it has fundamental logical flaws and introduces bugs:\n\n### 1. **Incorrect Loop Control Logic**\nThe original code properly iterates through containers using `container = container.next_sibling`, but the new code breaks this pattern. In the `else` branch, it sets `container = container.next_sibling` but then immediately continues the while loop, which will check `container.next_sibling` again instead of the current container.\n\n### 2. **Incomplete `fmt_on` Detection Logic**\nThe new `fmt_off()` function only tracks the final state of format comments but doesn't handle the case where `# fmt: on` should re-enable formatting within the same container. The original logic correctly tracked when `is_fmt_on = True` and would return early to stop ignoring nodes.\n\n### 3. **Flawed Column-Based Logic**\nThe `contains_fmt_off_at_column()` function has several issues:\n- It only checks direct children, not nested structures\n- The column comparison logic is incomplete - it checks if a child has `fmt_off` at a specific column but doesn't properly handle the relationship between `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` comments\n- It doesn't account for the semantic meaning of indentation levels properly\n\n### 4. **Missing Edge Case Handling**\nThe new logic doesn't handle cases where:\n- `# fmt: on` appears without a preceding `# fmt: off`\n- Multiple format toggle comments appear in the same container\n- Format comments appear in nested structures\n\n### 5. **Potential Infinite Loops**\nThe modified loop structure could potentially cause infinite loops or skip containers entirely due to the inconsistent iterator advancement.\n\n### 6. **Breaks Original Intent**\nThe original issue (#560) specifically mentions that `# fmt: on` doesn't work when crossing block boundaries. The fix attempts to address this by checking children at the same column level, but this approach is too simplistic and doesn't properly handle the AST structure and Python's semantic indentation rules.\n\nThe fix appears to be a \"quick and dirty\" solution (as mentioned in the PR description) that doesn't properly understand the existing logic flow and introduces more problems than it solves."}
