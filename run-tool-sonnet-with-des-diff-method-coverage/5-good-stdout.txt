{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The diff is false because it introduces a logical error in the trailing comma handling for function definitions.**\n\nThe main issue is in the `bracket_split_build_line` function where the new logic is added:\n\n```python\nno_commas = original.is_def and not any(\n    l.type == token.COMMA for l in leaves\n)\n\nif original.is_import or no_commas:\n    # Add trailing comma logic\n```\n\n**The problem:** The condition `not any(l.type == token.COMMA for l in leaves)` will be `True` when there are NO commas in the current line being processed. However, according to the bug description, we want to preserve trailing commas for functions with **one argument**, not functions with **zero commas**.\n\n**What should happen according to the issue:**\n- A function with one argument should keep its trailing comma\n- A function with multiple arguments should have trailing commas removed\n\n**What this diff actually does:**\n- It adds trailing commas to function definitions that have NO commas at all\n- This would incorrectly add commas to functions that don't need them\n\n**The correct logic should be:**\n- Check if we're in a function definition with exactly one argument (which would have exactly one comma - the trailing one)\n- Preserve that trailing comma instead of removing it\n\nThe first part of the diff (adding `syms.typedargslist` to the comma counting logic) appears correct, but the second part with the `no_commas` condition is fundamentally flawed and would cause incorrect behavior."}
