{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **false** because it introduces a bug that causes excessive blank lines to be added after comments between decorators.\n\nThe issue is in the logic of the added code:\n\n```python\nif is_decorator and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_comment:\n    # Always insert an empty line after decorator comments.\n    return 1, 0\n```\n\nThis condition will trigger for **every decorator that follows a comment**, not just comments that appear between decorators. The problem is that:\n\n1. The code doesn't distinguish between comments that are between decorators vs. comments that appear elsewhere\n2. It returns `1, 0` (one blank line) for ANY decorator following a comment, which contradicts the existing logic that says \"Don't insert empty lines between decorators\" (return 0, 0)\n3. The original bug report shows that Black was adding **two** blank lines, but this fix would add one blank line after every comment-decorator pair\n\nThe correct fix should:\n- Only handle the specific case of comments between decorators\n- Not add blank lines in that scenario (consistent with the \"no blank lines between decorators\" rule)\n- Preserve the existing behavior for other decorator scenarios\n\nThe current implementation would actually make the problem worse by consistently adding blank lines after decorator comments, which violates PEP 8 and flake8 rules about blank lines after function decorators."}
