{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The diff is false because it has the wrong logic for determining which grammars to use.**\n\nThe key issue is in this condition:\n```python\nelif all(not version.is_python2() for version in target_versions):\n```\n\nThis condition checks if **all** target versions are **not** Python 2 (i.e., all are Python 3+). However, the comment and the grammar selection that follows are backwards:\n\n1. **Wrong comment**: The comment says \"Python 3-compatible code, so don't try Python 2 grammar\" but the condition actually triggers when targeting Python 3+ versions.\n\n2. **Wrong grammar selection**: When targeting Python 2 (py27), we want to use grammars that **include** the print statement grammar, but the current code returns grammars that **exclude** print statements (`python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement`, `python_grammar_no_print_statement`).\n\n3. **The else clause fix is insufficient**: While the else clause correctly returns `[pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement, pygram.python_grammar]`, this only helps when the condition is false, but the main condition logic is still wrong.\n\n**What should happen for Python 2 target versions:**\n- When `--target-version py27` is specified, Black should use grammars that recognize `print` as a **statement** (not a function call)\n- This means using `pygram.python_grammar` which includes print statement support\n- The current code incorrectly uses \"no print statement\" grammars when targeting Python 2\n\n**The correct fix would be:**\n- Either flip the condition logic entirely, or\n- Restructure to explicitly check `if any(version.is_python2() for version in target_versions)` and handle Python 2 cases appropriately\n\nThe bug report shows that with `--target-version py27`, Black incorrectly adds whitespace between `print` and `(` because it's treating `print(\"hello\")` as a function call instead of recognizing that in Python 2 context (even with `from __future__ import print_function`), the grammar selection is wrong."}
