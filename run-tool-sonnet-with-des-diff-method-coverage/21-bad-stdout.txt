{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is **false** because it uses the wrong encoding.\n\nThe bug description clearly shows that the issue is a `UnicodeEncodeError` where the 'charmap' codec (cp1252 on Windows) cannot encode the Unicode character '\\u0142' (\u0142 - Polish letter). The error occurs because Windows defaults to cp1252 encoding for temporary files, which cannot handle this Unicode character.\n\nHowever, the fix uses `encoding=\"latin1\"` instead of `encoding=\"utf-8\"`. While latin1 might work for this specific character ('\\u0142' can be encoded in latin1), it's not the correct solution because:\n\n1. **The PR title explicitly states \"Open temporary files with utf-8 encoding\"** - but the diff uses latin1\n2. **UTF-8 is the proper universal encoding** that can handle all Unicode characters, not just this specific Polish character\n3. **Latin1 is limited** to characters 0-255 and would fail with other Unicode characters outside that range\n4. **The intent is clearly to use UTF-8** as stated in the PR description\n\nThe correct fix should be `encoding=\"utf-8\"`, not `encoding=\"latin1\"`. This diff solves the immediate test failure but doesn't implement the intended solution and could fail with other Unicode characters in the future."}
