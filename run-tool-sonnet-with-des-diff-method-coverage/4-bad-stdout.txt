{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The condition logic is backwards.**\n\nThe diff shows:\n```python\nbefore = (\n    # Black should not insert empty lines at the beginning\n    # of the file\n    0\n    if self.previous_line is not None  # This condition is WRONG\n    else before - self.previous_after\n)\n```\n\n**The problem:** The condition `self.previous_line is not None` means we're NOT at the beginning of the file (we have processed previous lines). But the comment says \"Black should not insert empty lines at the beginning of the file\", so we want to return 0 when we ARE at the beginning.\n\n**The correct logic should be:**\n```python\nbefore = (\n    0\n    if self.previous_line is None  # At beginning of file\n    else before - self.previous_after  # Not at beginning\n)\n```\n\n**Why this matters for the bug:**\n- The original issue shows a file starting with `\\` (backslash continuation) followed by empty lines\n- At the very beginning of the file (`self.previous_line is None`), we want to prevent empty lines from being inserted\n- But this diff does the opposite - it only sets `before = 0` when we're NOT at the beginning of the file\n- This means empty lines can still be inserted at the start of the file, failing to fix the unstable formatting issue described in #922\n\nThe fix attempts to address the right problem (preventing empty lines at file start) but implements the condition backwards, making it ineffective."}
