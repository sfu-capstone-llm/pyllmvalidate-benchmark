{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's incorrect:\n\n**The diff is false because it prevents legitimate line splitting when type comments are present, even when the line would be too long.**\n\nHere's the key issue:\n\nThe diff adds logic to check for \"special comments\" (type comments) and if found, it prevents line splitting entirely:\n\n```python\nif (\n    has_special_comment\n    and not line.should_explode\n    and is_line_short_enough(line, line_length=line_length, line_str=line_str)\n):\n    yield line\n    return\n```\n\nHowever, this logic is flawed because:\n\n1. **It only checks if the line is short enough AFTER finding special comments** - but the whole point of the bug report is that when Black combines parameters onto one line, it creates malformed type annotations that exceed the line length.\n\n2. **It doesn't actually fix the malformed annotation problem** - it just prevents splitting, but doesn't address the core issue where multiple `# type:` comments get concatenated incorrectly like `# type: int  # type: str  # type: bool`.\n\n3. **It will still allow the problematic behavior** when `is_line_short_enough()` returns True, meaning the malformed annotations will still be created for shorter lines.\n\nThe correct fix should either:\n- Restructure the type annotations into a single proper format like `# type: (int, str, bool) -> None`\n- OR prevent the collapsing of multiline functions with type comments entirely\n- OR handle the comment merging logic properly\n\nThis diff only adds a partial check that doesn't solve the fundamental problem of malformed type annotation concatenation described in issue #282."}
