{"is_correct": false, "reason": "Looking at this code diff, I can immediately identify why it's **false** - the diff removes the entire `# fmt: off`/`# fmt: on` functionality instead of fixing it.\n\n## Why this diff is incorrect:\n\n**The diff removes critical functionality entirely:**\n\n1. **Removes exception-based handling classes**: The diff deletes `FormatError`, `FormatOn`, and `FormatOff` exception classes that were used to handle `# fmt: off`/`# fmt: on` directives.\n\n2. **Removes UnformattedLines class**: This class was responsible for storing lines that shouldn't be reformatted when inside `# fmt: off`/`# fmt: on` blocks.\n\n3. **Removes format control logic**: In the `generate_comments()` function, the diff removes the code that actually detected and raised exceptions for `FMT_ON` and `FMT_OFF` comments:\n   ```python\n   # REMOVED CODE:\n   if pc.value in FMT_ON:\n       raise FormatOn(pc.consumed)\n   if pc.value in FMT_OFF:\n       # ... logic for handling fmt: off\n       raise FormatOff(pc.consumed)\n   ```\n\n4. **Removes visit_unformatted method**: This method handled visiting nodes when inside a `# fmt: off` block.\n\n**What the diff claims to do vs. what it actually does:**\n\n- **Claims**: \"Use the separate pass for # fmt: off on all code\" and \"removes the hacky exception-based handling\"\n- **Actually does**: Completely removes `# fmt: off`/`# fmt: on` functionality without implementing any replacement\n\n**The new approach is incomplete:**\n\nWhile the diff adds `normalize_fmt_off()` and `convert_one_fmt_off_pair()` functions that attempt to convert content between `# fmt: off`/`# fmt: on` into standalone comments, this approach:\n\n1. Only works as a preprocessing step\n2. Doesn't integrate with the line generation and formatting pipeline\n3. Doesn't preserve the original formatting of the ignored sections\n4. Doesn't handle the case where `# fmt: off` appears mid-statement\n\n**Evidence from the issue:**\n\nThe issue #335 shows that `# fmt: off` was being ignored after the first function, and the expected behavior was that everything after `# fmt: off` should remain unformatted. This diff would completely break that functionality rather than fix it.\n\nThis diff represents a failed attempt to refactor the `# fmt: off` handling mechanism that removes the working (albeit buggy) implementation without providing a complete replacement."}
