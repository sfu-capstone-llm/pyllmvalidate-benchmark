{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug described in the #335 issue. The bug was that `# fmt: off` comments are ignored after the first function, which was caused by the handling of `FormatOff` and `FormatOn` exceptions in the parser. \n\nThe fix involves removing the custom exception classes `FormatError`, `FormatOn`, and `FormatOff`, and the associated try-except blocks that relied on raising and catching these exceptions. Instead, the code now uses the `convert_one_fmt_off_pair()` function to scan the AST for `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` comments and convert the content between them into standalone comments, effectively making the `# fmt: off`/`# fmt: on` blocks explicit and correctly handled across statement boundaries.\n\nSpecifically, the changes include:\n- Removing the `FormatError`, `FormatOn`, and `FormatOff` classes.\n- Replacing the `hide_fmt_off()` function with `convert_one_fmt_off_pair()` that performs a single pass to convert one pair of `# fmt: off`/`# fmt: on`.\n- Wrapping this conversion in a loop (`while try_again:`) in `normalize_fmt_off()` to handle multiple pairs in the AST.\n- Updating `generate_ignored_nodes()` to stop at the first `# fmt: on` comment, ensuring that the content between `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` is isolated.\n\nThese modifications ensure that `# fmt: off` comments are correctly recognized and that the content between `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` is treated as standalone comments, which are then ignored by the formatter, fixing the issue where `# fmt: off` was ignored after the first function.\n\nTherefore, the code diff correctly implements the intended fix for #335."}
