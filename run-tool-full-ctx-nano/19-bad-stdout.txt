{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is false. The reason is that the added condition:\n\n```python\nif is_decorator and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_comment:\n    # Always insert an empty line after decorator comments.\n    return 1, 0\n```\n\ndoes not correctly handle the core issue described in the bug. The bug is about handling comments between decorators properly, specifically ensuring that blank lines are added after comments between decorators to satisfy formatting tools like black and flake8.\n\nHowever, the condition only triggers when the previous line is a comment and the current line is a decorator, and it forces an extra blank line after decorator comments. This does not address the main problem: comments placed between multiple decorators should be followed by a blank line, but the current code does not correctly insert blank lines in all relevant cases.\n\nFurthermore, the existing code already has a check:\n\n```python\nif is_decorator and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_comment:\n    # Always insert an empty line after decorator comments.\n    return 1, 0\n```\n\nwhich is similar to the added code, but the bug is about the scenario where comments are between multiple decorators, not just after a comment preceding a decorator.\n\nIn the provided test case, the comment `# TODO: X` is between two `@property` decorators, and the formatter should insert a blank line after the comment to satisfy flake8's `E304` error. The current fix does not guarantee that a blank line is inserted after comments between decorators, especially when multiple decorators are involved.\n\nTherefore, this diff does not correctly fix the bug. It only adds a condition that handles a specific case but does not comprehensively address the core issue of handling comments between decorators properly, especially in the context of multiple decorators and comments."}
