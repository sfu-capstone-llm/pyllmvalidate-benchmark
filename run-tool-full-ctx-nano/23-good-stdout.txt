{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug described in Issue #49, which is about the space before method brackets for built-in functions like `exec` and `eval`. The problem was that Black reformatted code to have a space before the parentheses in function calls, e.g., converting `return exec(\"code\", {}, {})` to `return exec (\"code\", {}, {})`, which is not PEP 8 compliant.\n\nThe fix involves modifying the `whitespace()` function to handle special cases for `exec` and `print` when they are used as function calls in Python 3, especially after the transition from Python 2 where `exec` and `print` had different syntax.\n\nSpecifically, the code added:\n\n```python\nelif (\n    prevp.type == token.RIGHTSHIFT\n    and prevp.parent\n    and prevp.parent.type == syms.shift_expr\n    and prevp.prev_sibling\n    and prevp.prev_sibling.type == token.NAME\n    and prevp.prev_sibling.value == 'print'\n):\n    # Python 2 print chevron\n    return NO\n```\n\nThis condition detects the Python 2 `print` statement with the `>>` operator, which is not relevant for Python 3 function calls. More importantly, the code also introduces handling for the `exec` statement:\n\n```python\nelif (\n    prevp.type == token.RIGHTSHIFT\n    and prevp.parent\n    and prevp.parent.type == syms.shift_expr\n    and prevp.prev_sibling\n    and prevp.prev_sibling.type == token.NAME\n    and prevp.prev_sibling.value == 'exec'\n):\n    # Python 2 exec statement\n    return NO\n```\n\nThis ensures that when `exec` is used as a statement in Python 2, the formatter does not insert a space before the parentheses in the Python 3 style.\n\nAdditionally, the code introduces new grammar variants to handle the `exec` statement in Python 2 and 3:\n\n```python\npython_grammar_no_exec_statement = python_grammar.copy()\ndel python_grammar_no_exec_statement.keywords[\"exec\"]\n\npython_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement = python_grammar.copy()\ndel python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement.keywords[\"print\"]\ndel python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement.keywords[\"exec\"]\n```\n\nThese variants are used in the parsing process to correctly identify the syntax context, which helps the formatter decide whether to insert a space or not.\n\nThe test code shows that the formatting of calls like `exec(\"code\", {}, {})` remains without a space before the parentheses, matching the expected style and fixing the bug.\n\nTherefore, the code diff correctly implements the fix by:\n\n- Adding special handling in `whitespace()` for `exec` and `print` in the context of Python 2 statements.\n- Updating the grammar to distinguish between statement and function call contexts for `exec` and `print`.\n- Ensuring that the formatter does not insert a space before parentheses in function calls for `exec` and `eval`.\n\n**Conclusion:** The diff correctly fixes the bug related to space before method brackets for built-in functions like `exec` and `eval`."}
