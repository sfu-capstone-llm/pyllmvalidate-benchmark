{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is false because it does not correctly support parsing of async generators in non-async functions as described in the bug report. The primary change in the diff is the addition of handling for the 'for' token in the tokenization process, specifically in this snippet:\n\n```python\n-                    if token == 'def':\n+                    if token == 'def' or token == 'for':\n                         if (stashed\n                                 and stashed[0] == NAME\n                                 and stashed[1] == 'async'):\n```\n\nThis change attempts to treat 'for' similarly to 'def' when stashed after an 'async' keyword, presumably to recognize 'async for' constructs. However, simply adding 'or token == 'for'' in this context does not address the core issue of parsing async generators within non-async functions. \n\nThe root of the problem is that the parser needs to recognize 'async for' as a valid syntax in non-async functions, which involves more than token recognition\u2014it requires changes in the parser grammar and AST handling to correctly parse and represent async generators in such contexts. The tokenization change alone is insufficient and does not ensure that the parser will correctly interpret 'return (i * 2 async for i in arange(n))' as an async generator expression within a non-async function.\n\nTherefore, this diff does not fully or correctly fix the bug as specified in the description."}
