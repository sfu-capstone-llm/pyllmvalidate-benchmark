{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug described in Issue #49, which involves the reformatting of built-in functions like `exec` and `eval` in Python 3. The issue was that Black's reformatting was changing the spacing in calls to `exec` and `eval`, which in Python 2 were statements and in Python 3 are functions, leading to inconsistent formatting.\n\nThe fix involves adding specific grammar variants that exclude `exec` and `print` as keywords, which are used to parse the source code differently depending on whether `exec` and `print` are used as statements (Python 2) or functions (Python 3). This is achieved by defining:\n\n```python\npython_grammar_no_exec_statement = python_grammar.copy()\ndel python_grammar_no_exec_statement.keywords[\"exec\"]\n```\n\nand\n\n```python\npython_grammar_no_print_statement = python_grammar.copy()\ndel python_grammar_no_print_statement.keywords[\"print\"]\n```\n\nas well as a combined variant:\n\n```python\npython_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement = python_grammar.copy()\ndel python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement.keywords[\"print\"]\ndel python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement.keywords[\"exec\"]\n```\n\nThese grammar variants are then added to the `GRAMMARS` list:\n\n```python\nGRAMMARS = [\n    pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement_no_exec_statement,\n    pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement,\n    pygram.python_grammar_no_exec_statement,\n    pygram.python_grammar,\n]\n```\n\nThe `lib2to3_parse()` function is modified to iterate over these grammar variants and attempt to parse the source code with each one until successful:\n\n```python\ndef lib2to3_parse(src_txt: str) -> Node:\n    \"\"\"Given a string with source, return the lib2to3 Node.\"\"\"\n    for grammar in GRAMMARS:\n        drv = driver.Driver(grammar, pytree.convert)\n        try:\n            result = drv.parse_string(src_txt, True)\n            break\n        except ParseError as pe:\n            # handle parse error and try next grammar\n            ...\n    else:\n        # if none succeeded, raise the last exception\n        raise exc from None\n```\n\nThis approach allows Black to correctly parse code that uses `exec` and `print` as functions in Python 3, avoiding unnecessary reformatting that would break the code style or cause syntax errors.\n\nAdditionally, the test files show that the formatting of `exec` and `eval` calls is preserved correctly, and the spacing around `exec` is maintained as in the original source, confirming that the fix works as intended.\n\n**Therefore, this diff correctly implements the fix for Issue #49 by introducing multiple parsing grammars to handle the different usages of `exec` and `print` across Python versions, ensuring consistent formatting without breaking code.**"}
