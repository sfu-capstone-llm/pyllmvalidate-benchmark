{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug. The reason is that it introduces a check for special comments, specifically type comments starting with \"# type:\", in the `split_line()` function. It scans the leaves of the line and sets `has_special_comment` to True if such comments are present. When `has_special_comment` is True, the function skips splitting the line, preventing the malformed merging of type comments into the function signature line. This ensures that multiline function type annotations with separate comments remain properly formatted, aligning with the desired behavior described in the issue."}
