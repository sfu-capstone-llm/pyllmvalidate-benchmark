{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly supports parsing of async generators in non-async functions, aligning with the new syntax introduced in Python 3.7. The change specifically modifies the tokenization logic to recognize 'for' statements that follow an 'async' keyword, which is essential for correctly parsing async generators like `return (i * 2 async for i in arange(n))`. \n\nThe key modification is in the `generate_tokens` function, where it now checks if the current token is 'for' and if it was previously stashed as 'async'. If so, it sets the `async_def` flag and records the current indentation level. This ensures that the parser correctly identifies async generator expressions even when they appear in non-async functions.\n\nFurthermore, the code correctly handles the case where 'async' and 'for' are used together in this context, which was previously unsupported. This change directly addresses the issue described in #125 and the PR's goal of supporting the new syntax.\n\nTherefore, this diff correctly implements support for parsing async generators in non-async functions, fulfilling the requirements specified in the bug report."}
