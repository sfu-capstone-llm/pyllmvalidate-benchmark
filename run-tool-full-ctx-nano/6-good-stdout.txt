{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug by introducing a new tokenizer mode for Python 3.7+ that treats `async` and `await` as reserved keywords. Specifically:\n\n- In `blib2to3/pgen2/tokenize.py`, a new `@dataclass` called `TokenizerConfig` is added with a boolean attribute `async_is_reserved_keyword`.\n- The `generate_tokens()` function is updated to accept an optional `config` parameter of type `TokenizerConfig`. When parsing, it uses the `async_is_reserved_keyword` attribute to determine whether to treat `async` and `await` as keywords.\n- In `black.py`, the `get_parser_configs()` function is modified to produce parser configurations with `TokenizerConfig(async_is_reserved_keyword=True)` for Python 3.7+ and `False` for earlier versions.\n- The `lib2to3_parse()` function iterates over these configurations, attempting to parse with each until successful, ensuring that `async` and `await` are always tokenized as keywords in Python 3.7+ syntax.\n\nThis implementation aligns with the requirement to support always tokenizing `async`/`await` as keywords in Python 3.7+ to fix issue #593."}
