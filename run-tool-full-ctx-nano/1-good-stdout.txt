{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This code diff correctly fixes the bug described in the #1138 issue by implementing a try-except block around the instantiation of ProcessPoolExecutor in the reformat_many function. When an OSError occurs during the creation of the executor\u2014such as in environments like AWS Lambda where /dev/shm is not accessible\u2014the code gracefully falls back to setting executor to None, which leads to serial execution. Additionally, the code properly shuts down the executor only if it was successfully created, preventing errors during cleanup. This approach aligns with the requirement to handle environments without shared memory support and to fallback to serial execution, thus fixing #1138 and #776 effectively."}
