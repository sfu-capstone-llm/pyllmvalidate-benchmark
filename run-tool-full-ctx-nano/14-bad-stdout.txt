{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug related to importing `__future__` with renaming, as described in the issue #389. The main change is in the `get_future_imports` function, where the code now properly handles `import as` syntax.\n\nPreviously, the code directly looked for `token.NAME` tokens within the import statements, which would fail when `as` renaming is used, such as:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import as _absolute_import\n```\n\nThe fix introduces a helper function `get_imports_from_children` that recursively processes the children of import nodes, correctly handling `import as` syntax by checking for `syms.import_as_name` nodes and extracting the original module name from their first child. This ensures that all `__future__` imports, including those with renaming, are correctly identified and added to the set returned by `get_future_imports`.\n\nAdditionally, the code now explicitly handles the `syms.import_as_names` node, which can contain multiple `import as` statements, by yielding from the recursive helper.\n\nThis change aligns with the requirement to correctly identify `__future__` imports even when they are renamed, which was failing before. The rest of the code remains unchanged, and the fix is focused solely on the import parsing logic.\n\nTherefore, this diff correctly implements the fix for the bug described in #389."}
