{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is false because it does not correctly address the core issue described in the bug report. The bug involves the incorrect calculation of indentation levels when the input uses tabs, which are counted as width 1 in the internal representation, but the code currently treats tabs as having a width of 4, leading to misaligned comments after dedents.\n\nThe code diff only modifies the `elif` branch that handles spaces and tabs:\n\n```python\n-            elif char == '\\t':\n-                current_column += 4\n+            elif char in ' \\t':\n-                current_column += 1\n```\n\nThis change consolidates the space and tab handling into a single branch, but it does not implement the correct logic for tab width calculation. Instead of counting tabs as a fixed width of 4, the code should compute the tab's width based on the current column position, typically aligning to the next multiple of 8 or a configured tab width, to match how tabs are visually represented and how the indentation should be calculated.\n\nTherefore, the fix is incomplete and does not resolve the core problem of correctly calculating indentation prefixes when tabs are used, which is essential for fixing the indentation issues with tabulated comments after dedent."}
