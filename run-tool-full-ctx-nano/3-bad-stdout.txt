{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug by changing the `exists` parameter to `True` in the `click.Path` option for `--config`. Previously, it was set to `exists=False`, which meant that the `--config` parameter could accept a path that does not exist. This caused the code to attempt to read a non-existent configuration file, resulting in an error with exit code 1.\n\nThe change to `exists=True` ensures that the specified configuration file must exist before proceeding. If the file does not exist, Click will handle the error appropriately, and the program will exit with code 2, as intended when a config file doesn't exist. This aligns with the requirement to catch the case earlier and treat it like other bad parameters, resulting in an exit code of 2.\n\nFurthermore, the unit test `test_invalid_config_return_code` expects an exit code of 2 when an invalid config file is specified, which is consistent with this fix. The fix ensures that the code now correctly distinguishes between a non-existent config file (exit code 2) and other errors, such as unreadable or malformed config files, which also lead to an appropriate error handling.\n\nTherefore, this change correctly addresses the bug by ensuring the exit code is 2 when the config file doesn't exist, matching the specified requirements and expected behavior."}
