{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the \"# fmt: on\" does not work crossing block boundaries and decorators issue (#560). The implementation introduces functions to detect and handle \"# fmt: off\" and \"# fmt: on\" comments, particularly `fmt_off`, `contains_fmt_off_at_column`, and `generate_ignored_nodes`. These functions analyze the prefix comments attached to nodes and determine whether formatting should be disabled or enabled at specific columns, especially within nested structures like decorators.\n\nThe core change occurs in `generate_ignored_nodes`, which traverses the container node of a given leaf and yields nodes until a \"# fmt: on\" comment is encountered, considering the column position. The `contains_fmt_off_at_column` function checks if any child node at a specific column contains a \"# fmt: off\" comment, ensuring that the formatter processes children separately when needed.\n\nFurthermore, the `generate_comments` function and related helpers are used to parse comments, and the `fmt_off` function evaluates whether a container node is within a disabled formatting region.\n\nThis approach aligns with the requirement that if \"# fmt: off\" exists within a node at a certain column, the formatter should process each child separately, excluding only those before \"# fmt: on\". The fix is based on the assumption that indentation has semantic meaning, and it correctly applies the \"# fmt: off/on\" logic to crossing block boundaries and decorators.\n\nSince the fix does not break existing tests and addresses the specific issue described in #560, it is a correct implementation of the intended fix."}
