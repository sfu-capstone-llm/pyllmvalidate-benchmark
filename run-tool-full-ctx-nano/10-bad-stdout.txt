{"is_correct": false, "reason": "This git diff is false because it does not correctly address the core issue described in the bug report. The problem is that indent widths in lib2to3 for tabs are counted as 1, not 4, and the prefix calculation needs to match that behavior to prevent indentation errors, especially with tabulated comments after a dedent.\n\nThe code diff only modifies the `driver.py` file, specifically the `_partially_consume_prefix` method, changing the handling of tab characters from:\n\n```python\nelif char == '\\t':\n    current_column += 4\n```\n\nto:\n\n```python\nelif char == '\\t':\n    current_column += 4\n```\n\nwhich is effectively the same as before, or possibly an oversight in the diff presentation. The key issue is that the original code counts tabs as 4 columns, which contradicts the bug's description stating that in lib2to3, tabs are counted as 1. Therefore, the fix should replace the line:\n\n```python\nelif char == '\\t':\n    current_column += 4\n```\n\nwith:\n\n```python\nelif char == '\\t':\n    current_column += 1\n```\n\nto match the actual behavior of indent widths in lib2to3 for tabs.\n\nSince the diff does not change the tab handling to count tabs as 1, it does not fix the bug. Instead, it leaves the core problem unaddressed, making this a false fix."}
