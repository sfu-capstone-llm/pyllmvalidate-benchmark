{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly implements the support for always tokenizing `async` and `await` as keywords in Python 3.7+, which is necessary to parse the new generator syntax that includes `async for` and `async with`. The changes introduce a new feature flag `ASYNC_IS_RESERVED_KEYWORD` and `ASYNC_IS_RESERVED_KEYWORD` in the tokenizer configuration, and set the tokenizer to treat `async` and `await` as reserved keywords when the feature is enabled.\n\nSpecifically, in `black.py`, the code adds a new `Feature` enum for `ASYNC_IS_VALID_IDENTIFIER` and `ASYNC_IS_RESERVED_KEYWORD`, and updates the `VERSION_TO_FEATURES` mapping to assign `ASYNC_IS_RESERVED_KEYWORD` to Python 3.7+ versions. It also updates the `get_parser_configs()` function to set the tokenizer configuration to treat `async` and `await` as reserved keywords for Python 3.7+.\n\nIn `blib2to3/pgen2/tokenize.py`, the `generate_tokens()` function is modified to accept a `config` parameter, and if `async_is_reserved_keyword` is set to `True`, it will parse `async` and `await` as keywords, not identifiers.\n\nThe test data files include code snippets with `async for` and `await` syntax, which previously caused parsing errors, but should now be correctly tokenized and parsed.\n\nTherefore, this diff correctly addresses the issue #593 by updating the tokenizer mode to treat `async` and `await` as keywords in Python 3.7+, enabling the parser to handle the new generator syntax."}
