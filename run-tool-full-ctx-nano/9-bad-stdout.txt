{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug. The reason is that the code change modifies the `get_grammars()` function to return the Python 3 grammar (`python_grammar_no_print_statement`) when the target version includes Python 2 (`PY27`). Previously, it was returning the Python 2 grammar (`python_grammar`) in this case, which caused the `print()` function to be formatted with an unnecessary space between `print` and `(`, e.g., `print (\"hello world\")`. The fix ensures that when targeting Python 2, the grammar used is the one that correctly handles the print function syntax, preventing black from inserting the extra whitespace. This change directly addresses the issue described in the PR and Issue #752."}
