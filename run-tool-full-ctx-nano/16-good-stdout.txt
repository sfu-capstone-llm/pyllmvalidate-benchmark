{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly implements the fix for the bug described in the #338 issue. The key change is in the function `gen_python_files_in_dir`, where it attempts to resolve each child's path relative to the root directory. If a `ValueError` is raised during this process, it indicates that the symbolic link points outside of the root directory. The code then checks if the child is a symlink, and if so, it logs that the symlink is ignored because it points outside of the root directory, and continues to the next item. This effectively ignores symbolic links pointing outside of the root directory, preventing the crash and aligning with the intended behavior described in the PR."}
