{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This code diff correctly fixes the bug described in the # Issue #22. The issue was that standalone comments inside nested bracketed expressions were blocking the expression from wrapping. The original implementation bolted comments onto the line with whitespace prefixes, which caused wrapping issues.\n\nThe fix introduces a new `standalone_comment_split` function that explicitly handles standalone comments separately from the main line splitting logic. It is added to the list of split functions within `split_line`, specifically in the `line.inside_brackets` branch:\n\n```python\nsplit_funcs = [delimiter_split, standalone_comment_split, right_hand_split]\n```\n\nThis change ensures that standalone comments are split out from the main expression, preventing them from blocking wrapping. The new function processes lines to identify standalone comments (type `STANDALONE_COMMENT`) and converts them into inline comments with appropriate prefixes, allowing the main line to be split and wrapped correctly.\n\nFurthermore, the code modifies the `split_line` function to include this new split function, which directly addresses the issue of standalone comments blocking expression wrapping.\n\nTherefore, the code diff correctly implements the intended fix by adding a dedicated handler for standalone comments, ensuring they no longer block expression wrapping, and fixing the bug described in #22."}
