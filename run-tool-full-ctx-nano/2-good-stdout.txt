{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug described in #560, which is that \"# fmt: on\" does not work correctly when crossing block boundaries and decorators. The fix introduces functions `fmt_on`, `contains_fmt_on_at_column`, and `first_leaf_column` to accurately detect whether a node or its children contain a \"# fmt: on\" comment at the same column as the node, and then processes children accordingly in `generate_ignored_nodes`. This ensures that the \"# fmt: on\" directive is respected at the correct scope, especially in cases involving decorators and block boundaries. The logic correctly processes the comments and their positions, and the changes integrate seamlessly with the existing code structure, providing a more precise handling of \"# fmt: on\" directives crossing block boundaries and decorators."}
