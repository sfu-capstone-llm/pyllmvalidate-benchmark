{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug. The bug was caused by the default file opening mode not specifying an encoding, which on Windows led to a UnicodeEncodeError when writing characters outside the cp1252 encoding, such as '\\u0142'. The fix explicitly sets the encoding to \"latin1\" in the `NamedTemporaryFile` used in `dump_to_file`, ensuring that the temporary files are written with a consistent encoding that can handle such characters. This change addresses the UnicodeEncodeError and ensures that files with Unicode characters are written correctly on Windows."}
