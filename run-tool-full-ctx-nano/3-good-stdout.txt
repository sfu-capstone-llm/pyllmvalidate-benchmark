{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug. The change updates the `--config` option's `click.Path` parameter from `exists=False` to `exists=True`. This ensures that when a user specifies a config file via `--config`, the path is validated to exist before proceeding. \n\nPreviously, with `exists=False`, the command-line interface would not verify the existence of the specified config file, which could lead to attempting to read a non-existent file later, resulting in a return code of 1. The change to `exists=True` causes the CLI to catch this error earlier, treating it like other bad parameters, and returning an exit code of 2 as intended by the logic in the main function.\n\nThis aligns with the requirement that invalid or non-existent config files should be caught earlier and result in an exit code of 2, improving error handling and debugging, especially in CI environments."}
