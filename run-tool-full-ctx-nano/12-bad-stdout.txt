{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug related to bracket matching in the context of formatting lambda expressions with default arguments. The original code used integer counters `_for_loop_variable` and `_lambda_arguments` to track nesting levels, which could lead to incorrect bracket matching in complex nested structures, especially with lambdas and for loops. \n\nThe fix replaces these counters with lists `_for_loop_depths` and `_lambda_argument_depths` that act as stacks, pushing the current `self.depth` when entering a lambda or for loop, and popping or checking the last element when exiting. This approach accurately tracks the nesting level of lambdas and for loops, ensuring that the bracket matching logic correctly identifies the scope of lambda arguments and for loops, preventing the bracket match bug.\n\nSpecifically, the code changes are:\n- Replacing `_for_loop_variable` and `_lambda_arguments` with `_for_loop_depths` and `_lambda_argument_depths` lists.\n- Updating `mark()` method to append the current `self.depth` to these lists when encountering 'for' or 'lambda'.\n- Updating `maybe_decrement_after_for_loop_variable()` and `maybe_decrement_after_lambda_arguments()` to check the last element of these lists against `self.depth` to determine when to decrement.\n- Commented out the `pop()` calls, which could be re-enabled if needed for further scope management.\n\nThese modifications ensure that the bracket matching logic correctly handles nested lambdas and for loops, fixing the bug described in #468."}
