{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug described in the issue. The problem was that when handling commented-out multi-line includes in import statements, the formatter produced invalid syntax by inserting a comma after a comment, which led to syntax errors during parsing. \n\nThe fix involves modifying the `bracket_split_build_line` function, specifically the section that adds a trailing comma for import statements. The code now iterates backwards through the leaves of the line, skipping over any standalone comment leaves (`STANDALONE_COMMENT`), and only inserts a comma after the last non-comment leaf. This prevents the insertion of a comma immediately after a comment, which was the cause of the invalid syntax.\n\nThe relevant code change is:\n\n```python\nif original.is_import:\n    for i in range(len(leaves) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if leaves[i].type == STANDALONE_COMMENT:\n            continue\n        elif leaves[i].type == token.COMMA:\n            break\n        else:\n            leaves.insert(i + 1, Leaf(token.COMMA, \",\"))\n            break\n```\n\nThis ensures that comments are not followed by a comma, fixing the invalid code generation issue. The fix is consistent with the bug report and the intended handling of commented-out multi-line includes."}
