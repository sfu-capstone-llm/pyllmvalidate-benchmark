{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug described in the #922 issue. The problem was that Black could produce files with empty lines at the beginning, especially involving line continuation characters (`\\`) followed by whitespace, leading to unstable formatting on subsequent passes. \n\nThe fix involves modifying the `maybe_empty_lines()` method within the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The original code calculated the number of empty lines before a line based on previous lines, but did not explicitly prevent the insertion of empty lines at the beginning of the file. The patch introduces a check:\n\n```python\nbefore = (\n    # Black should not insert empty lines at the beginning\n    # of the file\n    0\n    if self.previous_line is not None\n    else before - self.previous_after\n)\n```\n\nThis check ensures that if there is a previous line (meaning we are not at the start of the file), the calculation proceeds as before. But if `self.previous_line` is `None` (indicating the start of the file), it forcibly sets `before` to 0, preventing any empty lines from being added at the beginning of the file.\n\nThis change directly addresses the issue of empty lines at the start, which was the core of bug #922. It does so in a way that does not break any existing invariants of the formatter, as it only enforces no empty lines at the beginning, which is consistent with Black's expected behavior.\n\nTherefore, this diff correctly implements the intended fix for the bug."}
