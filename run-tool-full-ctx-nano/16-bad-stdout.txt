{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly implements the proposed fix by adding a try-except block around the line that computes `normalized_path` in the function `gen_python_files_in_dir`. Specifically, it catches `ValueError` exceptions that occur when a symbolic link points outside of the root directory, which makes the call to `relative_to(root)` invalid. When such an exception is caught, the code reports the ignored path and continues, effectively ignoring symlinks pointing outside of the root directory.\n\nThis change aligns with the requirement to ignore symbolic links pointing outside of the root directory, preventing the crash described in the issue. The existing code already attempts to resolve paths and compute their relative paths, which can raise a `ValueError` if the target is outside the root. The added exception handling ensures that such cases are handled gracefully, fulfilling the PR's goal.\n\nTherefore, this diff correctly fixes the bug by preventing crashes when encountering symlinks outside the root directory, and by ignoring such symlinks as specified."}
