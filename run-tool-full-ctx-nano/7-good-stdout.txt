{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly adds parentheses around long tuple unpacking in assignments, specifically targeting the pattern where the left side of an assignment is a backslash-continued tuple. The code modification in `normalize_invisible_parens()` detects when the first child of a node is a `syms.testlist_star_expr` (which corresponds to a tuple unpacking expression), and then wraps it in parentheses by inserting a new `Node` with `syms.atom` containing the parentheses and the original child.\n\nThis change directly addresses the issue described in #656, where lines starting as a backslash-continued tuple assignment on the left side are not shortened properly. By adding parentheses around such tuple unpack assignments, the formatter can produce shorter, more idiomatic lines, fixing the problem of lines not being shortened when they start with a backslash-continued tuple assignment.\n\nFurthermore, the code also handles cases where the child is a one-element tuple, wrapping it in parentheses to ensure proper formatting. The modification is precise and integrated into the existing `normalize_invisible_parens()` function, which is responsible for managing invisible parentheses.\n\nBecause the change is focused, correctly implemented, and directly addresses the issue of line length not being shortened in backslash-continued tuple assignments, this diff is a valid fix for #656."}
