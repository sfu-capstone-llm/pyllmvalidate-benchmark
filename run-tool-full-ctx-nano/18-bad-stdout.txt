{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug related to line endings on Windows by preserving the original line endings when rewriting files in place. It does so by analyzing the file's original line ending style using the `prepare_input()` function, which detects whether the file uses CRLF or LF line endings, and then passing this information (`newline`) to the `open()` calls for writing back to the file or stdout. When writing back to the file, it opens the file with `newline=newline`, ensuring the original line endings are preserved. When outputting diffs or writing to stdout, it uses the same `newline` parameter in `io.TextIOWrapper`, which maintains the original line ending style in the output.\n\nThis approach directly addresses the issue described in the bug report (issue #258), where Black outputs CRLF line endings on Windows even if the source file has Unix-style line endings. The fix makes the behavior configurable and preserves the original line endings, aligning with user preferences and expectations.\n\nTherefore, this diff correctly implements the preservation of line endings when formatting files in place, fixing the bug on Windows."}
