{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug as specified in the description. The main issue was that Black was combining multiline type comments into a single line, resulting in malformed annotations, especially when the comments are placed on separate lines for each parameter.\n\nThe fix introduces a check within the `split_line` function to detect if a line contains special comments like type annotations (using the `is_special_comment` function). If such comments are present, and the line is short enough, the function avoids splitting or combining the comments into a single line. This preserves the correct formatting of multiline type comments, maintaining their validity and preventing the malformed annotation issue.\n\nSpecifically, the added code:\n\n```python\n# we don't want to split special comments like type annotations\n# https://github.com/python/typing/issues/186\nhas_special_comment = False\nfor leaf in line.leaves:\n    for comment in line.comments_after(leaf):\n        if leaf.type == token.COMMA and is_special_comment(comment):\n            has_special_comment = True\n\nif (\n    has_special_comment\n    and not line.should_explode\n    and is_line_short_enough(line, line_length=line_length, line_str=line_str)\n):\n    yield line\n    return\n```\n\ncorrectly detects the presence of type comments and prevents their improper merging, fulfilling the requirement to support special comments in multiline functions without breaking the annotations.\n\nTherefore, this code diff correctly addresses the bug by ensuring that type comments are handled properly, either by leaving multiline comments as-is or restructuring them in a valid way, as described in the issue."}
