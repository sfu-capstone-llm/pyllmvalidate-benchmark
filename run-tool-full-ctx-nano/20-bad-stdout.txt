{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug by updating the code to display the full path in the diff output. The original code used `src.name` for the filenames, which only shows the filename without the full path. The change replaces `src.name` with `src`, which is the full path, in both `src_name` and `dst_name` variables:\n\n```python\n-        src_name = f\"{src.name}  (original)\"\n-        dst_name = f\"{src.name}  (original)\"\n+        src_name = f\"{src}  (original)\"\n+        dst_name = f\"{src}  (original)\"\n```\n\nThis ensures that the diff output will include the full path to each file, making it more consistent with other diff tools and easier to read when concatenating multiple diffs. The fix directly addresses the issue described in the #130 issue, fulfilling the requirement to show the full path on diffs."}
