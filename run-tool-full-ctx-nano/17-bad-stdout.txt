{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug related to handling empty files. The key change is in the `decode_bytes` function:\n\n```python\ndef decode_bytes(src: bytes) -> Tuple[FileContent, Encoding, NewLine]:\n    \"\"\"Return a tuple of (decoded_contents, encoding, newline).\n\n    `newline` is either CRLF or LF but `decoded_contents` is decoded with\n    universal newlines (i.e. only contains LF).\n    \"\"\"\n    srcbuf = io.BytesIO(src)\n    encoding, lines = tokenize.detect_encoding(srcbuf.readline)\n    if lines is None:\n        return \"\", encoding, \"\\n\"\n```\n\nPreviously, if `lines` was `None`, the function did not handle this case explicitly, which could lead to errors when processing empty files. The added check:\n\n```python\nif lines is None:\n    return \"\", encoding, \"\\n\"\n```\n\nensures that for empty files (which result in `lines` being `None`), the function returns an empty string for the content, along with the detected encoding and a default newline `\"\\n\"`. This prevents downstream errors when empty files are processed, fulfilling the requirement to handle empty files gracefully.\n\nAdditionally, the other change:\n\n```python\ndef lib2to3_parse(src_txt: str) -> Node:\n    \"\"\"Given a string with source, return the lib2to3 Node.\"\"\"\n    grammar = pygram.python_grammar_no_print_statement\n    if src_txt[-1] == \"\\n\":\n        src_txt += \"\\n\"\n```\n\ncorrects the logic to append a newline only if the source text does not already end with one, which is a common practice to ensure proper parsing. This change, while not directly related to empty files, improves robustness.\n\nOverall, the modifications in `decode_bytes` and `lib2to3_parse` ensure that empty files are handled correctly, preventing potential errors during formatting. Therefore, this diff correctly fixes the bug as specified."}
