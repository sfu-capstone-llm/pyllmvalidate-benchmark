{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug described in #335, which is that `# fmt: off` is ignored after the first function. \n\nThe root cause of the bug was that the handling of `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` comments was based on exceptions (`FormatOff` and `FormatOn`) that didn't work across statement boundaries, leading to the formatting being incorrectly applied or ignored after the first function.\n\nThe fix involves removing the exception-based handling (`FormatOff` and `FormatOn` classes and their associated try-except blocks) and replacing it with a more robust approach that converts content between `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` into standalone comments. This is achieved by the functions `normalize_fmt_off()` and `convert_one_fmt_off_pair()`, which traverse the AST and replace the content between these comments with explicit comment nodes, thus ensuring that the formatter treats these sections as unformatted blocks regardless of statement boundaries.\n\nSpecifically, the code changes:\n\n- Remove the `FormatError`, `FormatOn`, and `FormatOff` classes, and the try-except blocks that relied on catching these exceptions.\n- Introduce the function `normalize_fmt_off()` that repeatedly calls `convert_one_fmt_off_pair()` until no more pairs are found.\n- `convert_one_fmt_off_pair()` searches for `# fmt: off` comments, and when found, converts the content between `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` into a special comment node, effectively \"hiding\" the content from the formatter.\n- The function `generate_ignored_nodes()` is used to generate all nodes until the next `# fmt: on` comment, stopping at the end of the block.\n- This approach ensures that sections of code marked with `# fmt: off` are treated as comments and are not reformatted, regardless of statement boundaries.\n\nThe removal of exception-based handling and the explicit conversion of `# fmt: off`/`# fmt: on` blocks into comments directly address the bug, making the formatter respect `# fmt: off` after the first function.\n\nTherefore, this diff correctly implements the intended fix for #335."}
