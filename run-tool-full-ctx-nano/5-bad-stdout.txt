{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug described in #880. The reason is that the modification to the `maybe_remove_trailing_comma` function now includes the `syms.typedargslist` in the set of parent node types where trailing commas should be preserved for function arguments. Additionally, the line split logic has been updated to ensure that all lines in a function definition that contain only one argument have a trailing comma, aligning with the expected behavior.\n\nSpecifically, the code change:\n\n```python\nif leaf.parent and leaf.parent.type in {\n    syms.arglist,\n    syms.typedargslist,\n}:\n    commas += 1\n    break\n```\n\nensures that trailing commas are correctly handled for both argument lists and typed argument lists, including single-argument functions. This addresses the issue where functions with a single argument kept the trailing comma, and functions with multiple arguments had the comma stripped.\n\nTherefore, this diff correctly implements the fix for #880 by updating the `maybe_remove_trailing_comma` function and the line split logic to handle trailing commas consistently in function definitions with one argument."}
