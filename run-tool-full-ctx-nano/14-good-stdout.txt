{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug described in the issue. The core problem was that the previous implementation of `get_future_imports()` only handled import statements of the form `from __future__ import ...` with simple `import` syntax, and did not correctly handle the case where `__future__` imports are renamed (e.g., `from __future__ import absolute_import as _absolute_import`). \n\nThe fix introduces a helper function `get_imports_from_children()` that recursively extracts imported names, properly handling `import as` syntax, including `import as` for `__future__`. It then uses this helper to gather the imported names from the relevant import statement.\n\nSpecifically, the code change:\n\n- Replaces the previous code that directly iterated over `first_child.children[3:]` and added names to `imports` with a call to `set(get_imports_from_children(first_child.children[3:]))`.\n- Implements `get_imports_from_children()` as a generator that yields the original names, correctly handling `import as` syntax, including renaming `__future__`.\n\nThis ensures that when `from __future__ import absolute_import as _absolute_import` is used, the import name `_absolute_import` is correctly recognized as a future import, fixing the bug where such renaming caused the import to be missed.\n\nTherefore, the code diff correctly implements the fix for the bug described in Issue #389, ensuring that renamed `__future__` imports are properly detected."}
