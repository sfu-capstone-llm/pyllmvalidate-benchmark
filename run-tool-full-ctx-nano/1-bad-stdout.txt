{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug. The reason is that it modifies the `reformat_many` function to handle environments where `ProcessPoolExecutor` cannot access `/dev/shm`, such as AWS Lambda. Specifically, it wraps the creation of `ProcessPoolExecutor` in a try-except block catching `OSError`. If an `OSError` occurs, it falls back to a default `ProcessPoolExecutor()` without `max_workers`, which defaults to a single process, effectively falling back to serial execution. Additionally, it ensures that `executor` is set to `None` if the fallback occurs, and the shutdown logic is conditioned on `executor` not being `None`. This change allows Black to run in environments without `/dev/shm` support, fulfilling the requirement to gracefully fallback to a monoprocess implementation, thereby fixing issues #1138 and #776."}
