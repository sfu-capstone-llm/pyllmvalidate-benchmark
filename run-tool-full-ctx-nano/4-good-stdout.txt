{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This code diff correctly implements the fix described in the #922 issue. The core problem was that Black could produce files with empty lines at the beginning, especially involving line continuation characters (`\\`) followed by whitespace at the start of the file. The fix involves modifying the `maybe_empty_lines()` method within the `EmptyLineTracker` class to prevent Black from inserting empty lines at the beginning of the file.\n\nSpecifically, the code change adds a check:\n\n```python\nbefore = (\n    # Black should not insert empty lines at the beginning\n    # of the file\n    0\n    if self.previous_line is None\n    else before - self.previous_after\n)\n```\n\nThis ensures that if `self.previous_line` is `None` (which indicates that we are at the start of the file), the number of empty lines before the current line is forcibly set to zero. This prevents Black from inserting empty lines at the start, which was the root cause of the instability described in #922.\n\nGiven that the check is added in the `maybe_empty_lines()` method, which is responsible for determining the number of empty lines before a line, it directly addresses the boundary condition that was causing the issue. The rest of the code remains unchanged, preserving the invariants of the formatter.\n\nTherefore, this diff correctly fixes the bug by preventing the generation of empty lines at the beginning of files, aligning with the problem description and the intended solution."}
