{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug related to line ending preservation on Windows. The main change is the introduction of the `prepare_input()` function, which analyzes the input bytes to determine the original line ending style (`\\r\\n` or `\\n`) and the encoding. It then decodes the input accordingly and returns the newline style, encoding, and decoded contents.\n\nSubsequently, in functions like `format_file_in_place`, `format_stdin_to_stdout`, and related places where the code writes to stdout or files, the code now creates an `io.TextIOWrapper` with the original `newline` value, ensuring that the line endings are preserved exactly as in the source file. This wrapper is used for writing diffs or formatted code, and then detached to avoid interference with stdout buffering.\n\nThis approach directly addresses the issue described in #258, where Black outputs CRLF line endings on Windows even if the source file has Unix-style lines. The fix makes the behavior configurable and preserves the original line endings, satisfying the requirement to keep Unix line endings even on Windows.\n\nTherefore, the code diff correctly implements the fix for #258 by capturing the original line ending style and applying it during output, satisfying the bug fix requirements."}
