{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug related to handling comments in from imports, as specified in the PR description. The key change is in the function `bracket_split_build_line`, where, when constructing a new line inside brackets, it inserts a trailing comma only if the last leaf is not a standalone comment. This prevents adding a comma after comments, which was the cause of the invalid code with commented-out multi-line includes in the original bug report.\n\nSpecifically, the code:\n\n```python\nif is_body:\n    result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)\n    if leaves:\n        # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.\n        normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)\n        # Ensure a trailing comma for imports, but be careful not to add one after\n        # any comments.\n        if original.is_import:\n            for i in range(len(leaves) - 1, -1, -1):\n                if leaves[i].type == token.COMMA:\n                    break\n                elif leaves[i].type == STANDALONE_COMMENT:\n                    continue\n                else:\n                    leaves.insert(i + 1, Leaf(token.COMMA, \",\"))\n                    break\n```\n\nThis logic ensures that a trailing comma is only added if the last non-comment leaf is not a comma, and it skips over standalone comments. This fix aligns with the requirement to avoid adding a comma after comments, which was causing invalid syntax in the original bug.\n\nGiven that the fix is precisely targeting the problematic code path and implementing the correct logic to handle comments properly, the code diff is a true fix for the bug."}
