{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug by explicitly specifying the encoding as \"utf8\" when opening the temporary file in the `dump_to_file` function. The original code did not specify an encoding, which on Windows could lead to a default encoding that cannot handle certain Unicode characters such as '\\u0142'. The fix ensures that the temporary file is opened with UTF-8 encoding, allowing it to correctly encode all Unicode characters, including those causing the UnicodeEncodeError in the test logs. Therefore, this change addresses the root cause of the bug and is a correct fix."}
