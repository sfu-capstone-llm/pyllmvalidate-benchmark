{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This git diff correctly fixes the bug. The bug was that the `--diff` output did not show the full file path, making it hard to read multiple diffs, especially when filenames are duplicated in different directories. The fix was to change the lines:\n\n```python\n-        src_name = f\"{src.name}  (original)\"\n-        dst_name = f\"{src.name}  (formatted)\"\n+        src_name = f\"{src}  (original)\"\n+        dst_name = f\"{src}  (formatted)\"\n```\n\nfrom using `src.name` (which is only the filename) to `src` (which is the full path). This ensures that the diff output displays the full file path, maintaining consistency with other diff-producing programs and improving readability when concatenating multiple diffs."}
