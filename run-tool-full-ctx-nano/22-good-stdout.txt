{"is_correct": true, "reason": "This code diff correctly implements the fix for Issue #22, which involves handling standalone comments inside nested bracketed expressions so that they do not block line wrapping.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n- The original problem was that standalone comments inside nested brackets would block line wrapping because they were bolted onto the line without proper handling.\n- The fix removes the \"standalone comment hacks\" and now treats standalone comments as a separate type of split, allowing the formatter to split lines around them properly.\n- The code introduces a new property `contains_standalone_comments` in the `Line` class, which checks if the line contains any standalone comments.\n- The `split_line` function now checks `line.contains_standalone_comments` before deciding whether to split, allowing lines with standalone comments to be split correctly.\n- The `standalone_comment_split` function is decorated with `@dont_increase_indentation` and is responsible for splitting lines containing standalone comments, ensuring they are handled separately.\n- The `append_comment` method has been updated to handle comments properly, and the comments are stored separately in the `comments` list as tuples `(Index, Leaf)`.\n- The code no longer uses the previous hack of bolting comments onto the line with whitespace prefixes, instead treating standalone comments as separate entities that can be split and formatted correctly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll these changes align with the requirement to fix the issue by properly handling standalone comments inside nested brackets, allowing the formatter to split lines correctly without being blocked by comments. Therefore, this diff correctly fixes the bug."}
